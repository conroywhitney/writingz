I've worked on some cool projets. Well, *I* think they're cool, anyway.

* gringotts -- 2-factor authentication gem for rails
* u2b -- finding order in chaos
* nonporter -- interviews with real people with real worldviews 
* before-and-afer -- extreme photo editing
* insects -- pictures of bugs (mostly moths) that I find beautiful
* lorem ipsum -- finding that negative 
* libatious -- beer recommendations through collaborative filtering
* android applications
  * wagz -- inspire people to walk every day via virtual pet
  * screen off -- for phones whose power buttons broke (Nexus One *cough*)
  * app roulette & goldmine -- app recommendations through collaborative filtering
