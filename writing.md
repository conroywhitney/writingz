I like to write about things. I categorize them into two groups:

technology
=============
* programming -- general thoughts on improving our craft
* code -- examples and errors to help myself and others
  * android
  * ruby on rails
* cryptography -- discoveries and thoughts on privacy / crypto
* futuristic -- where is technology going?


life
==============
* religion -- who are we? why are here?
* philosophy -- what (if anything) should we do while we're here?
* politics -- how should we come together?
* business -- how should we compete?
* personal -- experiences while traveling and growing as a person
