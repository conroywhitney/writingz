<p><h4>"In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story."<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com</h4></p>

<p>If you are looking for inspiration and confirmation about your choice to strike out on your own, watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_bezos_gifts_vs_choices.html">Jeff Bezos' Princeton address "What matters more than your talents"</a>. He talks about his decision, 16 years ago, to quit his job at a financial firm in NYC to start Amazon.com. </p>

<h3>Cause.</h3>

<p>Just last week I quit a job that I liked at a company that I admired to run a one-man Android application development shop. Like Jeff, after talking with my boss I needed to take some time to "think about it"; I was being offered a promotion during the same meeting that I was letting my boss know I was planning to leave. Something like that requires serious re-consideration.</p>

<p>If you are like me and have second-guessed your choice because of what someone else has said to you, you are not alone! Even Jeff Bezos, mastermind of Amazon.com, net worth of $12.3 billion (billion with a 'b') in 2010, was advised by his boss to not make the choice to leave and start Amazon.com. Be inspired by Jeff's comments about his choice: "I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing; and I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.... I took the less-safe path to follow my passion; and I am proud of that choice."</p>

<h3>Effect.</h3>

<p>When you make life choices, you have to be daring; "a little bit swash-buckling", as Jeff puts it. There will always be people who will try to make you second-guess your choices; who will give their opinion about how you are deciding to run your life (even though you did not ask); and who give their own reasons why they would definitely not do what you are choosing to do.</p>

<p>This is a natural effect of choice. When you choose a new adventure (striking out on your own) and someone else is left with the old and familiar, both parties have a need to rationalize their situations. You, obviously, have your reasons, or else you would not be taking this large risk. They, however, need to re-justify their situation and why they are not choosing to make choices like you are. Sometimes, their rationalization involves belittling your choice; sometimes it involves explaining your choice away; inevitably, there will be someone who will (in as many words) tell you that you are making a bad choice.</p>

<h3>Take heart.</h3>

<p>Jeff presents the following dichotomies which I am calling "You vs. The World". In my opinion, you must choose to belong in one of the two columns; abdicating choice is a choice in and of itself. Choosing to be in the "You" column means you choose to take the road less traveled.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>The World</th><th>You</th></tr>
<tr><td>Let inertia be your guide</td><td>Follow your passions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Follow dogma</td><td>Be original</td></tr>
<tr><td>Choose a life of ease</td><td>Choose a life of service and adventure</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wilt under criticism</td><td>Follow your convictions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bluff it out when you're wrong</td><td>Apologize</td></tr>
<tr><td>Guard your heart against rejection</td><td>Act when you fall in love</td></tr>
<tr><td>Play it safe</td><td>Be a little bit swash-buckling</td></tr>
<tr><td>Give up when it's tough</td><td>Be relentless</td></tr>
<tr><td>Be a cynic</td><td>Be a builder</td></tr>
<tr><td>Be clever at the expense of others</td><td>Be kind</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Remember these dichotomies and remember that you and only you have the power to decide what life you will live.</p>
