I want to discuss a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">topic</a> <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/45905/210633">that</a> <a href="http://digg.com/news/entertainment/the_social_network_review_a_movie_about_our_need_to_be_accepted">not</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/01/hilarious-facebook-movie-the-social-network-in-one-minute-thanks-nma/">many</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Social-Network/105460422821089">people</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2269308/">have</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/sns-reznor-social-network,0,5014620.story">heard</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53OUHupfqws">about</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/SocialNetwork">recently</a>; a topic that <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/social.media/09/30/facebook.movie.zuckerberg/">the</a> <a href="http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/entertainment/movies/the-social-network-opens-with-likes-20101001">MSM</a> <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/09/21/businessinsider-facebook-movie-zuckerberg-ims.DTL">continues</a> <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/10/silicon-valley-goes-to-the-movies-to-see-facebook-on-the-big-screen.html">to</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/andrew-clark-on-america/2010/sep/23/facebook-mark-zuckerberg">ignore</a>. But first, we have to think back: The year is 2004. A new social network, <a href="http://thefacebook.com">The Facebook</a>, is just launching, started by an up-and-coming young go-getter...

I realize everyone (and their twitter handle) is talking about FB these days. All the same, I enjoyed this <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2269131/pagenum/all/">Slate article about "The Other Social Network"</a> which looks at 2004 from the eyes of one of FB's competitor in those days: <a href="http://www.wikicu.com/images/d/dd/CN_UserPhotos.jpeg">Campus Network (aka CU Community)</a>.

Below are my take-aways: lessons that I want to internalize instead of repeating others' costly mistakes.
<h3>Think Small</h3>
FB+CU were specifically for college students (read: a large, but well-defined vertical). As such, they had a base of users they could easily reach who were co-located, had similar demographics, and hung out in similar locations (both physical and virtual). Both FB+CU did a good job at narrowly defining their audience and pursuing them wholeheartedly.Would that all companies would deeply understand that "as big as possible" in and of itself is not a good goal.
<h3>Features Schmeatures</h3>
CU's team was working extremely long hours and sleeping in their office while working on adding features (e.g., customizable interfaces). If <a href="http://www.facebook.com/markzuckerberg">The Zuck</a> was working really long hours, it was researching the competition, planning strategy, and scaling infrastructure -- NOT investing in feature creep. I have respected the manner and pace with which FB has developed their product from the day I signed up in 2004. In a sense, I am glad that CU did not win, if only because the world does not need another MySpace.
<h3>Limited Resources = Fierce Competition</h3>
I personally can fall victim to varying degrees of what I call "ostrich complex": if I dismiss a threat as unimportant, it will simply leave me alone, right? It sounds like CU had this same problem but did not proactively combat this tendency; and they paid a top-dollar price ($200k) to learn their lesson. If CU had taken their heads out of the sand for long enough to realize that the 4 hour drive between Harvard and Columbia did <strong>*NOT*</strong> mean that they could co-exist in their respective niches, CU might have behaved much more aggressively (or defensively, whatever). History might have been different.
<h3>First Mover Don't Mean Shit (or: Execution is Everything)</h3>
This is the real message that I take away from this story: CU (and MySpace and Friendster) were first but FB ate their lunch anyway: they took away their users, <em>and their users were better off for it</em>. This is 2010. Your idea is <strong>*NOT*</strong> sacred. It does not matter if you are able to rightfully say "But they copied me! I was first!" Users want what users want, and they will take it from whoever will give it to them (the little whores). The only thing you can do is to take your idea and execute as damn well as you are able to.
<h4>And May the Best Team Win</h4>
