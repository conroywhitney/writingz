Within 72 hours of deciding to come to Guatemala, I had bought a ticket and was on a plane to the first third-world country I have visited. My decision was not based on things that I only learned later, once I was here; things like Mayan ruins, weather, what have you. I decided on Guatemala because I decided on a specific organization: [Buenas Cosas](http://www.buenascosas.org/) -- Good Things. Although what I anticipated and what I encountered where worlds apart, I still feel that I have learned what I (thought that I) came here to learn: that when we think of "[3rd world problems](https://www.youtube.com/water)", we are really projecting our own insecurities and weaknesses on others. The problems we talk about, like food, clean water, and healthcare are not really problems. In fact, the difficulties that we identify as problems are merely "the way things are" for people here.

Who are we, then, to come in from the outside and dictate *right* and *wrong*; to choose and emulate a superhero. "[We've got to be the best; we've got to change the world; we've got to use this chance to be heard; our time is now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYDuNq-a5b4)" What we find is that we are all in the same boat; that the things that we find important in our home are important in other people's homes as well.

What is universal is politics as usual. Money, power, and fame rule the upper echelons of government; city councilmen here retire within a few years with millions of $USD. Public land is sold to outsiders at a bargain. Any significant resistance by the people is considered a capital offense; a shoot-to-kill situation. No right to free speech here.

When I came here, that was not what I expected at all. If I am honest with myself, I expected to meet a challenge that could be solved by physical force -- moving cinderblocks, distributing supplies, sweating in the tropical jungle. It's not that at all, man. This is a mental match, and, just like at home, many of the citizenry are lacking the cognitive capabilities to defend against psychological warfare.

Where can we target our efforts in order to be most effective in this cerebral cold war? All the Sciences, History of Civilization, Knowledge of the Universe, History of Humanity…

…Communication: writing, comprehension, vocabulary, logic, ESL. What will really help this world move forward is helping those with ideas connect and converse with compatriots of comparable contexts. If we want to change the world, we first need to help people connect with each other. And isn't it all about connections, Senora?

Education is the most important single thing on this planet. People can go days without eating, but a starving mind can never be satiated. Malnutrition, disease, the wealth gap, and (as Mr. Daemon points out) lack of european toilets may be huge issues in this world, but none of those can be addressed without collective cooperation which requires collaborative conversation.

One of the (many) reason(s) why Communism failed, in my opinion, is because of the Vanguard. You can come in; you can rabble rouse; you can lead; but you will always be on the outside. Unless you educate -- not so much opinion as fact; and not so much fact as right-thinking -- you can never have a true democratic revolution.

Democracies are hard. They require knowledge. They require thought. They require contradiction, and compromise. Most of all, though, they require consent -- and unless the democratically-elected government has the consent of the people, it don't got shit.

So let's devote our time and efforts to educate people so they can form their own opinions. We are not here to dictate, but educate. We are not here to differentiate, but to elucidate. We are not here to deviate, but to elaborate. What we see, what we feel, what we do is what matters. Everything else is just money; is just pretend.
