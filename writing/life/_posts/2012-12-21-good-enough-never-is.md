I really enjoy reading <a href="http://www.cindyalvarez.com/" title="Cindy Alvarez">Cindy Alvarez</a> and I highly recommend that any product managers read and internalize her advice. If we all did, the world would be a much easier place with which to interact. Recently, I appreciated her post titled <a href="http://www.cindyalvarez.com/design/good-enough-vs-good-enough-never-is/">Good Enough vs. Good Enough Never Is</a> about how the phrase "good enough" is <b>*not*</b> an end, but rather a means to an improved product.</p>
<p>
To rephrase: "Good enough" is not an acquiescence to mediocrity; but rather an admission of ignorance and a dedication to learning.</p>
Cindy makes a great distinction that is a twist on the old adage "You are not your customer." Her distinction helps you decide when your product is "good enough" to release:  <quote> </quote>
<ul>
<li>There are things in my recently released product <b>which make me cringe.</b></li>
<li>There are things in my recently released product <b>which make our customers cringe.</b></li>
</ul>
It is a conscious effort for me to detach myself from something that <em>I</em> do not consider to be ready for release and to say "This is <em>good enough</em>." However, Cindy's distinction helps make that decision easier: at the current stage, does the product provide value to the customer without making them cringe? Nevermind what <em>I</em> think; I am not my customer.
There is always a trade-off between the time you spend on a product and the value a customer gets out of it. What we as product managers may see as "glaring" errors or omissions in the product may not be noticed or missed by the customer.
