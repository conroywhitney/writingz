<p>Lest ye think that Google Search has reached its apex of understanding human nuances, ponder the following scenario: A Google search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+lasagna+zucchini">"vegan lasagna zucchini"</a> yields results that are, in fact, not vegan. Google does its human-intention-determination magic and realizes that "vegan" and "vegetarian" are related terms, which is true. However, in this case, the distinction is quite important: all vegan recipes are vegetarian, but not all vegetarian recipes are vegan. That is to say, vegan is a subset of vegetarian.</p>

<p>I am so used to Google being right, that when I clicked into a result and saw cheese as part of the ingredients list, I assumed the recipe website had made a mistake! No way Google would have given me a result for a vegetarian recipe when I searched for vegan. Inconceivable that Google would make such an error. My mind could not comprehend that this could have occurred. I felt empty, and hollow inside. Like the ground had fallen out from beneath me. Why, Google? Why? I trusted you! You told me everything would be fine, but it won't! Everything's not fine!  <i>*breaks down and cries*</i></p>

<p>To me, this is less of an interesting "look, Google made a mistake" example, and more of a "look how much I trust Google in everything" example. The number of Google searches I perform a day is staggering. The speed and accuracy with which Google allows me to find exactly the answer to the question I have (even if I don't know how to properly ask the question in the first place) absolutely boggles the mind. The rate of error is so low that examples like this stick out as outliers. To think that 15 years ago, this technology didn't exist is inconceivable.</p>

<p>More importantly, though, if we as a society don't <a href="http://android.konreu.com/general/i-heart-the-internets-and-so-should-u/">fight to keep the internet free and open</a>, we may lose this ability, as Comcast, Time Warner, or eventually the US government, decide which search engines we can access, and what results we see. Google's technology isn't infallible (yet). Neither are corporations, politicians, or humans for that matter. Which is why nobody should ever be given the tools to surveil or censor the internet. Ever.</p>
