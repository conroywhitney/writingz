Sometimes, a single idea can completely rebase your perception of what is possible. For me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> is one of those ideas.
</p>

<p>
Imagine there's a special kind of safe. Inside the safe, a you and 4 other people store a bunch of money that you all agreed you will only use when a certain number of people (let's say a simple majority, so 3 out of 5 of you) decide to make the purchase. You don't know these people, so you aren't able to trust that 1 or 2 of these people might get it into their heads to take the money and run. But since this safe is so special, you don't <i>have</i> to trust them in order to benefit from this special safe.
</p>

<p>
How is the safe special? Instead of it being openable by inserting a single key which one person has to keep secure and promise only to use at the appropriate times, this safe has 5 keys and 5 slots where each of the 5 members can put their keys. The safe is designed to open with at least 3 of those keys are inserted, but will remain locked if only 1 or 2 keys are used. This means that in order to access the funds inside 3 of 5 members have to insert their keys to open the safe. As long as you keep your own individual key securely hanging around your neck, you can always have confidence that if money is taken out, at least 3 people in the group agreed to take out the money, and no minority of people was able to go against the majority's wishes.
</p>

<p>
Why is this important? In a word, Socialism. OK, maybe the word "Socialism" seems a bit extreme. But think about what sort of things can go inside the safe besides money -- "the means of production, distribution, and exchange", perhaps? I'll leave these sort of thoughts as an exercise for the reader. The important concept though, though, is that there is something that is shared in common (whatever is in the safe), and a decision on when and how to use that item can only be reached when a certain percentage of the group agrees. All votes are equally important. No action can be taken without buy-in. And, most importantly, no central authority is needed to count votes and declare "the yea's have it".
</p>

<p>
When your goal is to remove the necessity of an authority figure to mediate, coordinate, and arbitrate decision-making, in a world where you cannot necessarily trust your peers, you've got to carefully consider all the tools available to those ends. I believe Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm is one such tool and will play an important role in the future of decentralized, autonomous collectives.

P.S. If you are interested in further reading, this algorithm came to my attention through <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7050/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i/">"Bootstrapping an Decentralized, Autonomous Corporation"</a> which I found while reading the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper">White Paper on Ethereum</a>. You know, if that's what you're in to.
