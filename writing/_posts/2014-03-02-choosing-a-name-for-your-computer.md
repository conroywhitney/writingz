<p>An oldie but a goodie from 1990 on choosing names for servers: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178" rel="nofollow">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the document is about what *not* to do and why, but here's really the core of what is considered best-practice when choosing a naming scheme for multiple machines in a group:</p>

<blockquote>Naming groups of machines in a common way is very popular, and enhances communality while displaying depth of knowledge as well as imagination. A simple example is to use colors, such as "red" and "blue". Personality can be injected by choices such as "aqua" and "crimson". Certain sets are finite, such as the seven dwarfs. When you order your first seven computers, keep in mind that you will probably get more next year. Colors will never run out. Some more suggestions are: mythical places (e.g., Midgard, Styx, Paradise), mythical people (e.g., Procne, Tereus, Zeus), killers (e.g., Cain, Burr, Boleyn), babies (e.g., colt, puppy, tadpole, elver), collectives (e.g., passel, plague, bevy, covey), elements (e.g., helium, argon, zinc), flowers (e.g., tulip, peony, lilac, arbutus). Get the idea?</blockquote>
