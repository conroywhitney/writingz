<p>Do you like the internets?! Cuz I luuuuuuuuuuuv me sum internets!!</p>

<p>But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtt2aSV8wdw">this 3:33 minute video</a> says that the internets of tomorrow may not be as awesome as the internets of today because of a thing called "Net Neutrality"  :(</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>This whole FCC / Comcast / Netflix / "Net Neutrality" debate that everyone on the internets has been bitching about boils down this one question:</p>

<ul>

<li>Do you believe that the internet belongs to us, the people of the world, and that when we pay companies like Comcast or Time Warner in order to access the internet, we are paying to access ALL of the internet, without being told what we can and cannot see?</li>

<li>Or do you believe that the internet belongs to companies like Comcast and they have the right to limit our access to things on the internet like they currently do with cable TV channels based on how much we (or other companies like Netflix) pay them?</li>

</ul>

<p>20 years ago the internet was born. 15 years ago Google became a thing. 10 years ago YouTube had 1,000 views. 5 years ago Netflix streamed its first movie.</p>

<p>Let's not let a handful of politicians, lobbyists, and corporate executives muddy the waters of the most incredible and influential technological breakthrough of our lifetimes (so far).</p>

<p>Sign this petition and call your congress peoples to (politely) let them know that you're paying attention:</p>

<p>If you really want to put your name out in public in support of the internet, as that second video points out at the end, you can submit a real comment into the actual FCC proceeding to be made a part of public record:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to: <a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/hotdocket/list">http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/hotdocket/list</a></li>
<li>Click on: 14-28 "Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet"</li>
<li>Cringe at the horrible yellow webpage and ugly forms and realize: these are the people in charge of regulating the internets  :(</li>
<li>Enter your personal information and comments. I used this format:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
To whom it may concern,

I am writing to comment on the FCC's recent proposed changes to net neutrality. In particular, the decision to enact a 'fast lane' in which companies would be allowed to charge for faster internet broadband access.

The Internet is our most democratic medium.  It has grown exponentially, fueled innovation and altered how we communicate.  Network neutrality is the guiding principle that has allowed for these advancements.

As a concerned citizen I feel it is imperative that broadband access, and internet access in general, remain unfettered and classified as a Title II telecommunications service under the Communications Act.

Thank you very much for your time,
[Your Real Name Here]

<p>
You can also email the FCC about this issue at:  <a href="mailto:openinternet@fcc.gov">openinternet@fcc.gov</a>. You can use the same script as above with the subject line <b>"Reclassify Internet Service Providers as Title II Common Carriers"</b>.
</p>

<p>
You can also call the FCC directly as long as you remember that the person who is receiving the call has no impact on the actual policy and is just another human being doing their job. So be nice.
</p>
<ol>
<li>dial 888-225-5322</li>
<li>push 1, 4, 0</li>
<li>a person will answer.</li>
<li>they will ask for your name and address. you can just give them a zip code if you want.</li>
<li>"I'm calling to ask the FCC to reclassify Internet Service Providers as Title Two Common Carriers."</li>
<li>They'll ask if there is anything else you would like to add.</li>
<li>"No, Thank you for your time."</li>
<li>hang up</li>
</ol>

<p>And last but not least, there is always twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
We support #NetNeutrality and call on the @FCC to ensure companies large and small have equal access to the Internet
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
#NetNeutrality and an Open Internet is essential to maintaining a level playing-field for innovation. We call on the @FCC to protect it
</blockquote>

<p>
If you love the internets as much as I do, then please join me in telling the FCC that the internets belong to all of us, not to some stingy fat cats. The FCC should reclassify broadband internet as a Title II Common Carrier telecommunications service like electricity, and phones, and other stuff, that we consider important in our lives.

P.S. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2014/05/only-you-can-protect-net-neutrality_13.html">the girls and guys over at reddit</a> for their efforts in raising awareness about this issue. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5711012/net-neutrality-protest-posters-go-up-across-washington-ahead-of-fcc-vote">Alexis Ohanian's DC Ad Campaign</a> is brilliant. Creating this sort of in-real-life (IRL) awareness is both important and difficult. Keep up the great work!
