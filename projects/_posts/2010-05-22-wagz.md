<h3><img src="/assets/wagz/wagz-icon.png" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" />Wagz is a virtual dog who you take for a <strong>*real*</strong> walk every day. The longer you walk him, the happier he will be. The more frequently you walk him, the more he will love you!



Wagz will remind you when it is time to go for a walk every day so that you do not forget about him!</h3>

<blockquote>Wagz hopes that caring for a virtual dog (think Tamagotchi 2.0) will motivate you to get up and get going. The virtual Wagz dog, which you can customize to your liking, must be walked every day. The app tracks the time and distance of the walk. "The longer you walk him, the happier he will be. The more frequently you walk him, the more he will love you!" the developer explains.</blockquote>
