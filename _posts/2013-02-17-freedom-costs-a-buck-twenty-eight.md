 title: Freedom Costs a Buck Twenty-Eight
---

When you ask people the first word that pops into their head when they think of *America*, it is most likely *Freedom* (thanks George W). But to me, when I think of the word "free", I think of "without cost", like the Spanish word *gratis*. Instead, I like to use the word *liberty*, like the Spanish word *libre*. Or, if you want to keep using the same word, use a qualifier like ["*free*, as in speech" and "*free*, as in beer"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre Wikipedia - Gratis vs. Libre).

Going back to the "American" definition of *Freedom*, to me, freedom implies the ability to choose for yourself regarding things that are important to you; to be able to live your life how you want to, without any external restrictions. To me, this concept is the foundation of [Libertarianism](http://www.amazon.com/Libertarianism-What-Everyone-Needs-Know/dp/019993391X Amazon - Libertarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know): do what you please, but hurt no-one.

And this *freedom* isn't *free*. Indeed, every day we are seeing more and more how our elected officials at the federal, state, and city levels -- along with their forces of violence (military, national guard, and police, respectively) -- are not only out-of-touch with the rest of the population, but are out-of-control. How so? In the sense that they realize that they are not acting along with the will of the people, but they just don't seem to care. We are no longer co-creating how we as cities, states, and a nation want to shape our collective world; at some point, the people we have elected to serve our interests decided they were going to pursue their own agenda instead, independent of what the people actually want.

Each day we see more examples of how those whom we put into a place of service are ceasing to view the position as service and more as a place of control and dominance; how the oath of office, through which they swear (or affirm) to "[preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office#Federal_Executive_and_Legislative_Branch_Oaths Wikipedia - Oath of Office)" is apparently worth less to them than a roll of toilet paper; and how the issues and opinions of the citizenry are ignored in favor of working their own agenda for their own personal gain.

Take the recent [2013 Southern California shooting a.k.a. The Dorner Case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Southern_California_shootings Wikipedia - 2013 Southern California Shootings). To me, the Dorner case isn't important because of Dorner -- it is important because it shows us exactly what the powers-that-be in this country are willing to do to silence someone who has information that can be used against them. The first 2 weeks of February 2013 were eerily similar to [the ending of Fahrenheit 451](http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/451/summary.html - SparkNotes - Fahrenheit 451 Summary): a cop who learned some dirt about other cops; was set up to take a fall, but instead turned on his colleagues; and wherein a long, nationally-televised chase ensued consisting of excessive use of labels, force, and technology. Dorner is the first to be called a "domestic terrorist"; the first for whom the official policy was "wanted: dead (not alive)"; the first to have predator drones hunting him across 5 states. Whatever else Dorner was, he was a man who, based on his experiences, decided that "[the only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:V_for_Vendetta_\(film\)#V.27s_.22V.22_Speech WikiQuote - V for Vendetta)."

During this case, we were able to see LAPD cops labeling a citizen an "enemy combatant" and stripping away all of the constitutional and natural rights of him and other citizens caught up in the issue in the pursuit of what we are being told is "justice". Dorner was never going to have [the right to a fair trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial Wikipedia - Right to a Fair Trial) which is not only the ["Due Process" 6th Amendment to the United States Constitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), but is also Article 10 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights). From the very first moment that they felt threatened, the LAPD decided that it was allowed to operate outside of the law in order to supposedly uphold the law. That point was not thoroughly addressed by the Main Stream Media. And when confronted with it, the LAPD will make no apologies. 

This is only the beginning. There are going to be big changes in this country very soon. You've seen some of it being covered from around the world; but only as much as you and your favourite source of news want to recognize. The United States is just as corrupt; just as influenced by corporations; just as controlled by big banks as any "backwards 3rd world country" (believe me, I'm in one). The only difference is that we in the United States don't see it that way. We, for some reason still think that we have things under control, and that "our government" (a misnomer, at best) is still working for us.

Keep telling yourself that as more draconian laws are attempted again and again and again despite public backlash. Laws that are against public opinion, written in secret, passed in the middle of the night, with no opportunity for public discussion, and no appropriate press coverage. The perpetrators of these farces are attempting to undermine the [Bill of Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#Amendments Wikipedia - US Bill of Rights) which were enumerated by our founding fathers not to *give* us rights, but to make it clear that we *naturally have* these rights, and to spell it out for both citizens and government alike that these rights shall not and indeed can not be infringed.

Just as peaceful revolutions do not happen overnight, nor does the insidious hollowing out of a freedom-loving democracy. Instead, most of the attacks made on our rights have been subtle, hidden, or [directed at groups with which we do not identify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came...#The_text). Here are just a few examples, ordered by which amendments of the Bill of Rights they are attempting to undermine:


***[1st Amendment / Freedom of Speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Freedom_of_speech)***

 * [SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act#Impact_on_online_freedom_of_speech Wikipedia - Stop Online Privacy Act) was also termed "the Internet Kill Switch" or the "Great Firewall of the United States". When you hear about countries shutting down access to Twitter, or blocking access to web pages containing certain "controversial" phrases, that was the power that this law would have given to the Executive Branch of the US Government. It was stopped by a groundswell of citizen action, the likes of which have never been seen in our generation. If you want to learn more, I suggest you listen to [Aaron Swarz's talk at "Freedom to Connect"](http://www.democracynow.org/2013/1/14/freedom_to_connect_aaron_swartz_1986).

***[2nd Amendment / Right to Bear Arms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)***

 * [NY SAFE Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_SAFE_Act Wikipedia - NY SAFE Act) is a New York State gun-control law which was passed in the wake of the [Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting) and signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo, supposedly to reduce gun violence in NY. The content of the bill places limitations on which arms you have a right to bear based on arbitrary criteria like their appearance and magazine size, and changes ownership requirements which labels many previously-law-abiding citizens as criminals. The content is one thing, but the method with which it was passed is a whole other story. The law was not discussed publicly (as is required in NY State), it was forced through the Senate late at night, without senators being able to read its content, and it was immediately signed into law. This was an obvious bid by Cuomo to "lead the nation" in gun-control, as a set up for a 2016 political move. The public backlash on this topic will (hopefully) all but guarantee his ineligibility for further public office. [This hilarious Cuomo-as-Hitler meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Awhpw0mj4) can explain it all for you in just a few minutes.
 
***[4th Amendment / Unreasonable Searches and Seizures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)***

 * [New York City's Stop-and-Frisk Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_stop-and-frisk_program Wikipedia - NYC Stop-and-Frisk) is a controversial program in NYC where the NYPD routinely detain "random" people on the street, pat them down, and "ask" them to empty their pockets / backpacks. When any illicit items are found (weapons, drugs, spray paint, etc.), the people are arrested and the NYPD gets to meet their high quotas. The reality of it is that the stops are not "random" but are disproportionate by neighborhood and ethnicity. In addition, this program is controversial because the NYPD do not need to have any "probable cause" to detain someone. The salient point here, though, is that the NYPD are attempting to trump the constitution -- and are getting away with it, at least with citizens who do not know their rights or do not have public advocates.

 * [CCTV's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television). We have gotten quite used to having closed-circuit cameras (CCTV's) tracking us inside banks, or malls, or even restaurants. Having lived in NYC, I also got very used to seeing CCTV's at many street corners throughout the entire city. I went to Ground Zero and counted something like 20 CCTV's along a 100-foot walkway. I am OK with CCTV in the following circumstances: they are truly closed-circuit (i.e., the video stream does not leave the physical location where the camera is);  they are only accessible by authorized personnel with a warrant (i.e., there has to be a reason for someone to look at the video, like as evidence for a suspected crime); the content is only maintained for a limited amount of time (not indefinitely); and the public and the media have a right to request CCTV content (most of the time, the government confiscates videos from all cameras surrounding "events"). What I am *not* OK with is for someone in a control room somewhere to be able to follow my movements around the city, in real time, without a warrant. Call me old-fashioned, but I consider that to be an invasion of my privacy; an unreasonable search; a violation of my 4th amendment rights.

 * [The Ramping up of Domestic Drone Usage](http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/drones-congressional-research-service-report/) is like CCTV, but in the skies, with a much larger purview, and much less transparency. We have seen these drones be used to kill innocent ment, women, and children in countries like Pakistan. We just saw them be used to hunt a man down so they could kill him. And looking into the future, we will see them be used to monitor internet usage ([like Google was doing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/30/google-street-view-wifi-suit-_n_888243.html)), the movements of law-abiding citizens through vehicle tracking and facial recognition, or even to look inside of our homes with infrared or other electromagnetic imaging. The point is that this is yet another tool *they* can use to invade our privacy, and we are in a unique position to nip it in the bud before the programs grow to the anticipated 30,000 drones in the next 20 years. I urge you to [learn more about the threat](http://www.campaignforliberty.org/national-blog/the-drone-threat/), [learn about what we can do in response](http://www.campaignforliberty.org/national-blog/restricting-drones-over-america/), and [stand up against tyranny](http://www.chooseliberty.org/welcome_drones.aspx).

 * The [PATRIOT Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Controversy) and [NSA Warrantless Wiretappings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy) are kinda old news, but to me that makes it even worse. How have we lived with these "laws" on our books for 12 years? How have we grown so accustomed to the retort "Why do you care if you ain't got nothin' to hide?". How can we accept this egregious, daily violation of our rights in exchange for a hypothetical, abstract sense of safety? An oldie but a goodie by Benjamin Fraklin: "If we restrict liberty to attain security we will lose them both."

***[5th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text Wikipedia) and [6th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Rights_secured Wikipedia) rights***

 * [NDAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012#Indefinite_detention_without_trial:_Section_1021 Wikipedia) attacks our 5th amendment right to not "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law", as well as our 6th amendment right to "a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury … and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation". When our government started saying it was OK to hold people -- including US citizens -- indefinitely without trial, without charge, and without letting them contact anyone (not family, not a lawyer, no one), we as a country started going down a very sad road indeed. The [writ of habeas corpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States#Habeas_corpus_in_the_21st_Century) has been a recognized human right our ancestors since the [Magna Carta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta) in 1215. Without it, today, "the U.S. military [can] pick up and imprison without charge or trial civilians, including American citizens, anywhere in the world…". Why do we let them take the power to do these things? We don't have to; indeed, we shouldn't.

***[8th Amendment / Cruel and Unusual Punishment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text)***

 * The [Aaron Swarz case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz Wikipedia - Aaron Swarz), is related to the guy who was linked to under the 1st Amendment section for the SOPA bill. He was instrumental in ensuring that we still have the free (*libre*) internet that we have today. He was a brilliant, talented, moral young citizen, staunchly on the right side of freedom, who helped make the internet what it is today. In response to a personal project of his -- [The Guerilla Open Access Manifesto](http://pastebin.com/cefxMVAy) -- he had his 8th amendment rights violated which eventually led to his death. He was persecuted by the United States government for many months, threatened with 30 years in jail and $1M in fines, for a victimless crime in which the "defendant" waived their right to prosecute. All the US Government wanted Aaron to do was to admnit that he was a felon and they would drop the charges. They thought they could then proclaim to the world that the beloved hero of the internet was a criminal. Aaron couldn't accept that possibility; he saw his actions as heroic, not criminal. If the US Government had not violated his 8th amendment rights, with credible threats of outrageous punishments for something which was victimless, Aaron might still be alive today. A cautionary tale if there ever was one.

***[9th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) and [10th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)***

 * The supremacy of States' Rights over federal laws is being questioned in ongoing legal battles over a variety of different situations: gay marriage, medicinal / recreational drugs, etc. What's at stake here is more than whether you can buy hash brownies at your local dispensary. The 9th and 10th Amendments ensure that the federal government cannot trump the rights of states, and the states cannot trump the rights of the individual. Once you assert that the federal government has the final say, no matter what states say, you lose a large part of how our country is constructed, both legally and philosophically.

As long as we stay asleep and fail to address the fact that those we have placed in positions of power are not acting in our best interests, the harder it will become to turn this ship around. As long as we keep ignoring the fact that the people the cops are defending are not us, but those with power, we will fail to correctly see [which side of the glass we are on](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXSkfTedVb0 YouTube - Nine Inch Nails - Right Where It Belongs). And as long as our city police in places like NYC, LA, Chicago, and others continue to operate as the world's toughest street thugs -- with powerful weapons, advanced technology, and [little to no oversight or public accountability](http://www.alternet.org/story/152063/how_california_law_shields_violent_police_officers AlterNet - How California Law Shields Violent Police Officers) -- we can expect more and more situations of citizens being attacked, shot at, and killed by excessive force.

First, [you've got to get mad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLXuh8Bo76M YouTube - The Network - Get Mad)! If you are not angry, then you don't get it (yet). But anger is not what we want to hold on to. We need to move past that. If we get held up on negative emotions and violent thoughts, we will be no better than they are. We need to realize that the reason these people have been able to degrade our democracy as much as they have is because we have let them. We have not been doing our job as true patriots, which requires constant vigilance. We have been asleep for too long. But change is in the air. We are on the right side of history. We need to transcend the place of hate and find the connection that we have with each other. Let me say that again: we don't need to *connect* with each other, we just need to *find the connections* that we already have. Once we realize that we have the power, have always had the power, and that nobody can take that power from us -- we can only give it away -- all we have to do is wake up. Take back what is ours by natural right. And restore this world to the way that we want it to be -- together.

Remember: Freedom isn't Free. It cost ["a buck 'o five" in 2004](http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/teamamericaworldpolice/freedomisntfree.htm), which is [$1.28 today, adjusting for inflation](http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Calculators/Inflation_Rate_Calculator.asp). Yeah. 22% cumulative inflation in 8 years. So that's a thing.
