 title: Quantum Zen
---

Quantum Zen is the underlying truth that everything is connected, and that balance is the key to personal happiness and right-doing. It emerges from a mixture of eastern philosophy and modern science (hence the name, Quantum Zen). It is based on four tenets: Connection, Non-Duality, Balance, and Choice.

Connection
---------------
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is Everything

At the lowest level, this principal starts out with the belief that all matter is "simply" condensed energy. We know that all matter moves between different phases: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Moving between these different states represent and increase or decrease in the kinetic energy of matter. This shows that matter itself is energy. We usually think of energy as light, heat, radiation, etc. But now we can think of everything as energy: people, animals, plants, rocks, water, etc. When we have mad this paradigm shift, we are able to appreciate the miracle of what we call "reality".

At the next level, this principal leads us to think about where all this energy comes from. Modern astronomy has taught us that all energy was present and connected at the "Big Bang"; that everything that exists today was present in what they term "The Singularity": the whole universe compressed into a single point. It was from this point that everything we see and think and feel comes from. Since all energy was present and connected at one point, quantum physics has learned that energy (and thus matter) is *still* connected today at a very basic (quantum) level. Thus, all that we see around us that seems unique and disconnected is actually still part of one large mesh of energy and is still connected: the "fabric" of the universe.

At the highest level is the idea that we are connected not only at our atomic level, but in our daily functions and survival. We are not cartesian actors (from Descartes) in a disconnected world; we cannot be removed and studied apart from our environment. We are part of our environment and have a give-and-take relationship with it. Modern environmentalism still espouses the idea that we are stewards who need to take care of "Mother Earth". This concept does not go far enough. Instead, we need to realize that we are one and the same as our environment; that any damage to this world -- living beings or otherwise -- is damage to ourselves.

Non-Duality
----------------
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Black is not Black Without White

Opposites are mutually-defining. You cannot have and appreciate Black without White. Black puts White into the highest contrast; it helps make White stand out. Consider the night sky. If there were no stars and the whole sky was pitch black, you would not have the sense of sky. If instead the whole sky was White (like in a big city), yo would not be able to distinguish between and appreciate each star and constellation. 

You cannot have and appreciate Black without White; Creation without Destruction; Life without Death. Love is not Love without Fear.

The age-old concept of a "spiritual battle" between Good and Evil (as is present in many religions) is a result of not accepting the truth: that Good *is* Evil, and Evil, Good. They are one and the same thing.

It is important to see the whole. Things are not Cause and Effect; rather, Cause and Effect are part of the same thing: The Event.

The Yin-Yang is not a static symbol, but rather is ever-moving, ever-changing, like a lava lamp. Sometimes Black overtakes White, but White cannot be "conquered", because in the defeat of White is the end of Black.

Balance
--------------
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Hedonism and Asceticism

When we realize the nature of opposites, we can then understand that our ultimate goal is Balance. Balance gives purpose and joy to our lives.
We can be too animalistic or too ascetic. People who indulge in "sinful" things (drugs, sex, alcohol, etc.) can feel and appreciate the loss of control; the focus on the physical. Similarly, people can abstain from "sin" and enjoy the feeling of control in their lives, and focus on the spiritual. As long as we realize and think about what we are doing, we can enjoy our actions for what they contribute to (not take-away from) our lives.

Each person individually needs to find the level of balance that is correct for their lives. Balance is tough. The middle-road is not the easiest to follow. Instead, we need to be conscious of each choice that we make, and be sure that it is taking us where we want to go.

Balance is also about appreciation. For example, many who consume a Western diet have meat and animal products with almost every meal. In this way, many have come to take these very special and sacred things (taking life from other life) for granted. Vegetarians and Vegans go to the opposite end of the spectrum by abstaining from all meat and animal products. While this means that they are respecting life, they are not able to truly appreciate it. The middle-road, in this case, are those who primarily exists on a plant-based diet but, when consuming meat, do so in moderation and with the idea that this event is special and sacred and to be enjoyed (grokked) to the fullest. This is just one example of finding balance in life.

Choice
---------------
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;With Great Responsibility Comes Great Power

The most important thing that we do in our lives is choose. We choose who we are, and what we do. We choose how we treat other human beings and other life on this planet. We choose how we let our thoughts and feelings influence our actions. We choose our lives.

Modern theoretical physics has taught us that the universe as we know it is just one of infinite many in what is termed "the multiverse". One way of thinking about the multiverse is like a fork in the road. Just as in Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken", we all come to crossroads in our lives and decide which path we want to take. Whichever path we choose, an equal and opposite universe is born, in which we chose the opposite. As we continue down our chosen path, our alternate selves are now leading a different life, with different choices and events that we may never experience. The infinite number of choices present in each universe means that there are infinite new universes created.

In order to keep from being overwhelmed by this thought, think of it simply as this: our choices matter, so make sure that what we do with our time, our mind, our life is what we want it to be. We can choose to be or do anything that we want. We can choose to say (or, equally as important, to *not* say) anything that we want. We just judge and choose for ourselves whether these things that we do or say are part of a life that we want to live.
