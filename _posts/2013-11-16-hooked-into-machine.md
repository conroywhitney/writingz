Google's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">"deep learning"</a> clusters (aka the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/all/">Google Brain</a>) are responsible for figuring out what the hell we intend to communicate when we type broken Spaglish into Google Translate or what words we used when we mumble to Google Voicemail on a windy afternoon.

The deep learning cluster is also being developed in order to recognize objects (and, *sigh*, yes, faces) in photographs. So far this system is really good at <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/06/google-x-neural-network">identifying cats in YouTube videos</a> (which, that alone, is worth the price-tag) and, as it turns out, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/15/google_thinking_machines">paper shredders</a>.

Wait. Paper shredders? What gives? Who cares?

Well, according to Google engineers at the recent Machine Learning Conference in San Francisco, the paper shredder phenomenon is anecdotal evidence that the algorithms underlying these deep learning machines have started to develop their own way of looking at the world that is different from our puny human brain.

<blockquote>"Google researchers can no longer explain exactly how the system has learned to spot certain objects"</blockquote>

This is a two-parter. First, off the programmers themselves were unable to come up with any ideas explaining how these algorithms are able to distinguish paper shredders in images. Secondly, us meat-sacks did an even worse job at identifying this particular type of office supply than our computer counterpart.

So there you have it. <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/reginaspektor/machine.html">The future is here; it's bright; it's now</a>; and it's somehow related to paper shredders.
