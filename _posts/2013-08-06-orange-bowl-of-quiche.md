I'm not sure why dates are so important. Yesterday was yesterday; today
is today; and tomorrow will be tomorrow. The distinction between the
three "different" time periods is arbitrary. The past is both
unreachable as well as everpresent: you can not go back and change
things you've done, but neither can you completely forget them. Sure,
you can let go; and sure, you can try to no longer remember, but that does not
alter the fact that the past is still here with you, right now, in the
present; if only in your mind and the minds of others.

The future is also a crazy distinction, and by that I mean, if you
distinguish between the present and the future, you're crazy. Whatever
you want, whatever you hope, whatever story you want to live, if you are
not working on those things now, in the present, then the future will
forever be just that: the future.

So what then is the present? Well, for one thing, the present is always
here; it's always now. And yet... it's never actually here. By Zeno's
Paradox, there are an infinite amount of infinitely small time periods
inbetween a second ago, this second right now, and a second from now, so that we are
constantly stuck in this exact moment. It's called a paradox for that
reason: it makes sense on paper, but obviously that can't be true, right? Because if I'm always right
here right now, how could I ever have past memories, or ever have hope
for the future?

In one sense, it can seem kind of depressing: to be stuck in the same
place and time; with the past being false implanted memories; and the present always being something
unattainable, like a carrot on a stick. But in another sense, it's
incredibly liberating: all the things you remember from your past are
just lessons you have learned to help you decide what to do right now;
and everything you hope for the future is encouragement to decide to
start making those decisions and doing those things right now.

If you are doing what you want to be doing, based on what you've learned
from your past, and working towards what you want for your future, then being stuck in
the same moment over and over actually isn't such a bad thing after all.
Imagine a time where you felt happy... wait, no, happy isn't the right
word: imagine a time where you felt free, liberated, energized; enjoying
what you are doing, knowing that it's what you want to do and will lead
you to the future that you want to be your history; and no matter what
challenges you come across, you meet them, confront them, and say "Move, bitch, get out mah way! I ain't got time fo
choo!"

I had exactly those sorts of experience over the past 12 hours. "Please
do tell more!" you ask? *deep breath* OK, I have a confession:

I baked quiche all last night, from midnight until 4am, inbetween having a one of the most
profound conversations of my life over Facebook chat with someone that I
met on my journies but had never really spoken with. My night was full
of good music (if you call Blue Man Group "good"), good
actions (if you like making dough and chopping onions), good vibes (if
you're into the whole kitchen scene), good thoughts (if you like hope),
and good conversation (if you like philosophy).

It was like a dream, or as they might say here "una buena halucina". But
it was real. It was, at one time in my past, my present. And, I plan,
that in my future it will once again be my present. Specifically, in
just a few hours, when I do it all again.

I knew -- like *conocer* not *saber* -- that what I was doing was what I was
supposed to be doing. The feeling is hard to describe, but there was a
certain peace that I felt; a rhythm; a patience; an intensity that
showed a glimmer of a dimension of reality that I have known before, but
has been covered up by the feelings and emotions that I have been
carrying with me from my past, and which I feel now that I have let go.
The feeling I felt was the product of mental, emotional, and spiritual growth coupled with
the alignment of spirit, will, and actions. During those hours, I
created my own little bubble of paradise.

And then came a test. As I was wrapping up, a crisis occurred in the
workplace, and a question was presented before me: do I put others'
(temporary) happiness over my (future) happiness? I tried to keep my bubble in tact.
Even over the panicing, franticness, and chaos that ensued, I *tried* to
keep my cool (emphasis on *tried*). I continued my Facebook conversation,
keeping it high-level, along the lines of: my patience is being tested
here; I'm trying to do the thing that I feel so strongly that I should
be doing, and want to do, and that leads me to a future that I want to
live; and this thing, this past, this always-hungry energy monster of a
situation is trying to zap all of that from me. No matter what I do,
now, or in the future, this hostel will always have more problems, and
always need more of my energy -- that's what working for others is all
about; and until I say "Enough!", it won't ever stop.

They replied with the most encouraging and honest advice that I've heard
in a long time: that it sounds like I've done all I can for my hostel;
and that's all that I can ask of myself, let alone anyone else can ask
of me. That I'm not God; that I can't fix all the problems in the world;
and that if I try, I will not only fail to do so, but I will cause a
multitude of problems in my own life, like what happened in the past
week.

That was exactly what I needed to hear, but I decided not to listen,
quite yet. I decided instead, to try to do both: to do my thing, and to
do the hostel thing. Long story short, the next hour and a half was complete hell.
I ended up trying to do all the jobs all
the time, meanwhile watching my window of opportunity to do *my* thing, that I had worked so hard and long on, and dreamed about
for so, so long, and was actually taking steps to move me towards a future
that I wanted to live... disappear...

I eventually said, "I'm sorry, but I've been here, and I've seen this
before, and I don't want this. I love you, and I am not trying to make
your life harder, but I need to just say 'fuck it' and do my own thing."

And so that's what I did.

I finished cleaning up after myself, I wrapped up my quiches, put them
in a nice little orange bowl on top of a red-and-white striped towel for
presentation, and walked out the door. That marked a huge decision in my
life, and the culmination of lessions that I had learned but not taken
to heart in the past. It's one thing to be completely selfish all the
time and never think about what other people need or want. But it's
another to never be able to say "No!" when there is something important
to you is being threatened.

The 3 minutes walk to the bus station was the most invigorating of all
my life. I felt free; liberated; hopeful; wonderful; I felt like myself
-- like I was back on track doing what I knew I should be doing. The
hour and a half of hell in the hostel became a distant memory. All I
remembered was the 6 hours of wonderful conversation, and the exact
moment in the present, where I was, with each step, with each detail
noted, and each breath taken. Where the night before there had been a
little bit of apprehension over how exactly I was going to sell these,
all of that was gone by the time I arrived. It did not matter what
happened, because whatever came to pass, I had done what I needed to do
to get myself to where I needed to be. It was a wonderful feeling.

It was a bit awkward at first, to be sure, trying to sell things. And I
got in trouble with "the law" once. But eventually, I ended up sitting
down for a bit to just watch the sunrise. I
had my bowl of quiches in my hands, and I was watching the faces of
people pass, but whenever there was someone who I could tell felt
awkward standing next to someone who was selling something on the street
(no judgements, I know that awkward feeling, too; just now I know it
from this side of the sidewalk), I would just use that opportunity to look
up at the beautiful landscape.

One person that I recognized from the
hostel commented on how cloudy it was this morning. I replied: "I don't
see it that way. I see it as the morning mist receding back into the
mountains from which it came." Which is true. That's what I see here in
the morning; it's such a magical place and a magical time of day at
dawn. I love this place, to be sure. It's got great views and great
vibes.

A group of girls from Cuzco
that I've met a few times, and are very far-out, man, asked me if I was
selling muffins. And I said, nope, I'm not selling them, but I'm
accepting donations; and they're not muffins, they're quiches.

That idea had just come to me in the few minutes earlier, after getting
reemed by the policia: donations. If I enjoy
making these quiches, and I enjoy sitting here watching the sunrise, and
I enjoy giving people something yummy to eat on their way up to their
"big day" at MaPi, and I don't like taking money from people, and if I'm going to get beaten for "selling", then
fuck it, why not just make it a donation basis? Radiohead did that with
their album and made more than if they had sold it through normal
channels. It's a new form of business that people are trying; why not
try it too?

A little while later, the strangest thing happened; the thing which I think is
a capstone to this whole entire week, and, maybe so far, my whole entire
trip. This very beautiful Peruvian young
woman, well dressed, well made-up, and the absolute most perfect
features that a Peruvian woman can have, come up to me, and without looking me in the eyes, and without
responding to my "Buenas dias", put a couple coins in my
bowl, without taking anything, and walked away calmly.

I have not gotten very many signs from the universe in my
life that I have recognized, but that one I understood: I'm on the right path; I've got the
right ideas; I'm doing the right things; don't give up; don't get
discouraged; because there is still beauty and there is still generosity
in the world. I only waited a few more minutes after that, but I felt
completely satisfied -- satiated. I had done what I'd come for. I'd been patient the
whole day before, while my plans were being postponed; I'd had a deep
and honest conversation with someone about my past, my present, and my
hopes for the future; I'd done all the work that I needed to do to get
myself on this path that I want to follow; I encountered obsticles in my
way, but I did not let them sidetrack me (too much); I realized things
about myself this past week which echo of my mistakes in my past life;
I've learned things about myself, patterns, habbits, that I know now how
to avoid (if I want to); and most of all, I finished it. From beginning
to end, I kept at it, I kept following my dream. At so many points in
this whole time, I could have given up, or gotten lazy, or sacrificed my
dreams for someone else's needs, but I didn't. I stuck at it, probably
the most that I've ever done with anything in my life. I feel like I
graduated or something; like, earned some degree in Following Your
Dreams.

And this is only the beginning. I still have a shit tonne more to do. So where do I go from here? I have a future that I want
to become my present, so my best option then is to live that, now,
today. Because tomorrow will never come. There is only the now. There is
only what I choose to do in this very moment.

P.S. No, my dream is not to bake quiches, but it was an important step.
What I want to do, I like to call:
