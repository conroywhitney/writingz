 title: Learning the Hard Way
---

He was 65. He had lived. When he looked in the mirror, he saw himself -- not what a Polaroid would see, but his past and present blurred into a slurry of authenticity. Every lesson he had learned, he learned the hard way. Even now, 39 years after he really began his journey, and who knows how many before he completes it, he neither asks for nor accepts any unsolicited advice. His reality is his own, and no one else's. Sure, the process could be quicker, smoother. Maybe there would not have been so much hurt and heartache; but then again, maybe there would not have been so much  learning: real, relevant, rapacious learning. Not the kind of stuff you are told by your father, then promptly ignore. Nor the stuff you read in books and can never quite grasp until after the fact. None of that for him. He did [the best that he could do given the information at his disposal](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Simpsons/Season_15#My_Big_Fat_Geek_Wedding Simpsons Big Fat Geek Wedding). He will not and can not apologize. He can only admit that in hindsight, he can see more clearly the effects of his decisions. Never will he say that he would have made different decisions. He could not have. He would say: to hypothesize is to create an entirely different past and therefore a different present. And in this present, he is authentically himself. Why, he would ask, would he want to be anything else?
