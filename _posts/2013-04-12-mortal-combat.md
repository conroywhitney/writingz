Don't laugh, but I used to dance when I was a kid. I think that was
after I quit Karate because of my Sense's lack of respect while trying
to teach us about respect. I was recently told by a martial arts expert
that my experience should have taught me to confront my elders /
teachers / bosses to let them know that even though I might be in a submissive
position, and I agreed with their message, I found their presentation to
be over-generalizing and thus scolding those of us who had not
trespassed. Like this one time, in band camp, our conductor called out
a bass clarinette player in public, but later apologized in person. No
-- it doesn't work that way -- if you have something to say to a subset,
you say either in private or you qualify your presentation to let others
know where they are in the right. Chances are, in the latter case, you
will still strike chords amongst the innocent because, let's face it, we
all have guilty consciences: we always feel that we could be doing
better in some way or another.

I have gone to exactly two yoga experiences in my life. The first time
was an incredibly spiritual circumstance, while the latter (and probably
the reason I never went back) was incredibly embarassing. Focusing on
the positive, though, the first time I was complimented by the
instructor (this being my first time), and was asked a very odd question
as part of the compliment: "Where did you learn such control over your
body?" At the time, the real answer was that I knew that my body was
only a manifestation of my consciousness; that this reality is a
hologramic arena for experiencing life and love, and my body is no more than a
virtual reality simulation that I can use to learn more. But I instead
said: Uhh... I dunno? I used to dance when I was a kid?

After Karate, I started tap lessons. Indeed, I was the star of a dance
number performed to the tune of "Rock Around the Clock" in which (since
I was the only male present), I got to dress up in a shiny black jacket,
white shirt (with sleeves rolled up), and blue jeans. My fifteen
seconds of fame was when I got to slide on my knees towards the front of
the stage while girls in hoop skirts tapped away behind me. Kick, step,
shuffle
ball-change. I felt like a boss; though, if any of my friends had seen
me, they probably would have tried to make me feel embarassed. Funny
thing is, I don't even remember who I was friends with at that time.
Puts things in perspective, no?

After that, I went on to do a bit of jazz (uh huh), pilates (what the
fuck?), and theatre (Scarlett Pimpernell FTW!), I can honestly say that
(in retrospect). Through all of that, though, I never really realized what it means to dance. OK, so,
I took classes, and had performances, and acted, and all that shit. And
I get music, believe me -- one-two-three, one-two-three,
step-ball-change. But *dancing* is something different.

Listening to "Graduation" (aka Pachabell's Cannon with High School Dream
lyrics), I cannot help but remember high school dances. My school had
square dances ("Do-si-do but don't touch your parther, that's a no-no").
I was OK at that. And I did some amateur swing dancing in my living room
with my older sisters' friends (there are pictures to prove it). My
school also had the equivalent of a prom where we got to boogy down at a
friends' house dressed up in our finest.

Yet still, dancing never really clicked for me. I only know that now
that I know what dancing entails. A total lack of inhibition. A
continued moment of ecstacy expressing your true spiritual being. When
you really dance, you let go of your ego, and are ruled by your id and
superego (not that I necessarily know what that is, but it sounds good,
right?) Dancing is a form of grounding yourself to the physical and the
moment, but it is also a way to escalate yourself to another plane by
ascending past the usual cognative barriers that limit your higher self.

Sounds kooky, right? Maybe that's just my way of explaining it, but I'm
sure, if you have ever experienced it, you know exactly what
I'm talking about. It took some time for me to attain that level, though, because
it's not what you might call "book learning" (which I am very good at,
if I may say so myself) -- it's something internal. The first time I
felt it, I proclaimed to the world: I dance! I'm a dancer! (see: What
About Bob?)

After that, for me, it became something that I *need* to do in order
to express myself and forgoe the physical world. Every time since, when
I achieve that level of experience, I am full of love, and light;
ecstacy and joy. I lose myself in the music and realize that my body is
only a tool for me to use towards my goal of spiritual assimilation.

Maybe I'm just weird. When I see most other people dance, I can tell
that spirituality and self-actualization is not very high on reasons for
dancing. For example, I went to a Valentine's Day dance in Guatemala,
which turned out to be not much more than a highschool dance. It was
quite entertaining, actually: clusters of males sitting on one part of
the bleachers, and (many fewer) clusters of girls standing idly,
presumably waiting for the guys to grow the cajones to ask them to
dance. The ratio must have been ten-to-one males-to-females. Strangely,
still, very few people were dancing. High School.

The mood was so serious that I myself succame to the fear of revealing
my true nature in front of so many strangers. Funny thing was, though, I
was with two females with whom I would have been glad to dance, and vice
versa. Still, we sat there in the defeaning din of the gymnasium being
totally bored. Well, I wasn't bored -- I was watching others and taking
in the awkwardness of the whole situation. But eventually, it came down
to: do we leave? or do we dance?

So dance we did. It took some time to get into the spirit of it due to the
overwhelming, base, oppressive nature of the others around us; but once we were able
to rise above, it was excellent. The best part for me was being conscious about
my self-consciousness, and relishing in the gringo-ness of my (lack of)
dance moves. At one point I mentioned to my partner that we (or, more
specifically, I) was making the situation more awkard for everybody --
but, I argue, that's in part their fault for taking it so seriously to
begin with. You could cut the tension in that room with a knife.

From my point of view, they were doing it all wrong. Dancing is not
entirely about sexuality (though obviously that has a lot to do with
making dancing fun). That's exactly it, though: it's about fun, and joy,
and elation, and having a good time, and laughing at yourself a bit. But
I guess when you take yourself so seriously, dancing perhaps loses a
part of its wonderfulness. Que lastima.

Here in Peru, though, I think they do it right. It's actually quite an
interesting phenomenon -- very communal. The idea is that you have a
group (usually three or more -- dancing as a couple is unusual) who
stand in a circle and more-or-less claim a space on the dancefloor where
they are going to be for many hours. Thus begins the ritual of enjoying
the dancing experience, which is repeated indefinitly until the group is
ready to retire.

One person buys a 1L beer and comes back with a small glass. While one
person is drinking from the glass, the next person around the circle is
holding the bottle. When the drinker is done, the holder pours
themselves a glass and passes the bottle to the next person drinking. If
someone does not want to drink at the moment, they simply decline, and
forfeit their turn. The mechanics of this social construct mean that at
any given time, only two people have their hands occupied, while the
others are free to dance uninhibited. And given how much movement is
involved in dancing freely, not having to hold on to a glass is mas
mejor.

Compare it to in the states where everyone has their own
indiviual drink which they need to keep track of and thus either leave
it unattended or need to carry it with them while they dance. Thus the
archetypal image of people mid-dance-move holding a glass in one hand
above their head while simultaneously trying to enjoy the dance without
spilling their costly cocktail. Or the people who simply don't dance,
cause really, who can dance with one hand stationary?

And that's all I have to say about that.

P.S. When I started writing this, I was dancing my heart out to a remix
of the "Mortal Combat" theme
song (of all things). When I finished, I was dancing to the song "What Is Love?" from "A
Night at the Roxberry." Nobody here but us chickens!
