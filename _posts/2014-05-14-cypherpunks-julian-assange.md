<p>When I first heard of the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk">cypherpunk</a>, I immediately felt a strong sense of belonging. A cypherpunk is "any activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography as a route to social and political change." I might even go so far as to say that reading about this group from the 1990's and their ideals is what first turned me on to cryptography in the first place.</p>

<p>I must confess, though, that I had mixed expectations about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cypherpunks-Julian-Assange-ebook/dp/B00AZBI4IO/">the book of the same name by Julian Assange</a>. I expected it to be an ode to Wikileaks. Instead, it was an inspiring conversation between four intelligent and passionate activists (Jacob Appelbaum, Andy Muller-Maguhn, Jeremie Zimmermann, and Julian Assange) hoping to make the world a better place through the use of cryptography -- a reunion of some of the original cypherpunks where they discussed how things have changed (for better and for worse) in the past 20 years.</p>

<p>I found Cypherpunks to be an inspiration towards my most-recent calling. Even before this book, I have found myself fascinated by the concepts and applications of privacy, cryptology, and decentralization, and how technologies based around these ideals can ensure a free and private internet for the future. I believe that tools we create towards this end need to be consumer-ready and integrated into everyday life. Cypherpunks, to me, then, was an all-around encouragement to continue pursuing this path.</p>

<p>At the core of being a cypherpunk is the core tenet that:</p>

<blockquote>Cryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action.</blockquote>

<p>It is with a certain amount of glee that our hosts describe how the laws of math and physics -- that is, of this natural world around us -- conspire <i>on our behalf</i> to give us the underlying principles of cryptography. But it's not enough to only create tools to further the cause of a free internet, but also to educate and encourage others to poke and prod at technology -- in other words, to become a hacker in the radical sense of the word. Recently I have realized, as they discuss in the book:</p>

<blockquote>It is important to understand these systems, because when we don’t understand them there’s a general trend to defer to authority, to people who do understand them or are able to assert control over them... Free [as in speech] software is one of the bases for a free online society, in order to have the potential to always control the machine and not let the machine control you.</blockquote>

<p>These authors do not take their tasks lightly. Indeed, they frame the challenges of our era as some of the most important in the history of humanity.</p>

<blockquote>
We must make it clear for everyone that a free, open and universal internet is probably the most important tool that we have to address the global issues that are at stake, that protecting it is probably one of the most essential tasks that our generation has between its hands, and that when somebody somewhere—whether it’s a government or a company—restricts some people’s ability to access the universal internet, it is the whole internet that is affected. It’s the whole of humanity that is being restricted.
</blockquote>

<p>In no uncertain terms do Assange et al mince words about their opinions on the state of the present digital dystopia, both in the United States and abroad. Through numerous examples, they demonstrate how the extent to which the internet is surveilled and data is collected and retained is far beyond what the average citizen of the world would expect.</p>

<blockquote>
We are all living under martial law as far as our communications are concerned, we just can’t see the tanks—but they are there.
</blockquote>

<p>This is an important point to establish and continue to re-establish, because without this external threat -- that is, groups intent on surveilling and censoring -- there would be no raison d'être for cypherpunks to exist in the first place. Yet never fear, ye who crave persecution! Society has come up a number of excuses in order to censor or surveil the internet, which our hosts affectionately term</p>

<blockquote>"The Four Horsemen of the Info-pocalypse": child pornography, terrorism, money laundering, and The War on Some Drugs.</blockquote>

<p>Assange et al, however, argue that the present state of surveillance that they describe is less about security and more about governments retaining power:</p>

<blockquote>
 [Secrecy] is about slowing down processes in order to better control them.... Even the democratically-run governments have a self-interest, which is to control.
</blockquote>

<p>So what do we do as citizens of a surveilled society when we no longer agree with the direction in which our governments and corporate overlords are heading? They advocate a dual approach: political policies on privacy, and cryptographic tools.</p>

<blockquote>
There two approaches to dealing with mass state surveillance: the laws of physics; and the laws of man. One is to use the laws of physics by actually building devices that prevent interception. The other is to enact democratic controls through the law.... The notion is that you cannot trust a government to implement the policies that it says it is implementing, and so we must provide the underlying tools, cryptographic tools that we control, as a sort of use of force, in that if the ciphers are good no matter how hard it tries a government cannot break into your communications directly.
</blockquote>

<p>As far as cryptographic tools go, in order to truly effect further privacy and the open internet, we (as newly-initiated cypherpunks) should be conscious of the adoption rate of our software. Generally today we have half-assed, open-source attempts at mimicking successful commercial products (believe me, I've written <a href="https://github.com/conroywhitney">my fair share of it</a>). The truth is, though, that a few well-intentioned hackers can never match strides with billion dollar corporations creating consumer software. And in order to further the cause, we need adoption of secure software and practices by real people in everyday life.</p>

<blockquote>
We should continue to build tools to make citizens more able to build their own decentralized encrypted infrastructures, to own their communication infrastructure.... We need something better than saying that we should have a poor-man’s version of Facebook and expect people to use it...
</blockquote>

<p>There is no specific prescription for this conundrum, however. Only a general admonition to steer away from esoteric implementations and aim for the adoptable and commercially viable alternatives. In fact, the free market was even suggested as a possible ally in furthering the cypherpunk goal of distributing privacy-oriented programs.</p>

<blockquote>
I’m convinced that there is a market in privacy that has been mostly left unexplored, so maybe there will be an economic drive for companies to develop tools that will give users the individual ability to control their data and communication.
</blockquote>

<p>Overall, despite all of the doom-and-gloom regarding the present (perceived) state of the digital dystopia, I found Cypherpunks to be cautiously optimistic and incredibly inspiring. The tools of true freedom are so close within our grasp. It is, in some sense, a race between those who seek to prop open the closing doors of a free (and un-surveilled) internet; and those who would see the internet as a tool of suppression and oppression. The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is potentially a truly and permanently free society. But we must reach it before our cause suffers a potential blow through increased surveillance and censorship. (<a href="http://android.konreu.com/general/i-heart-the-internets-and-so-should-u/">*cough*cough* Net Neutrality *cough*cough*</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
We still have a world built on weapons, on the power of secret-keeping, on an entire economic framework and so on, but that is changing.... We see this internet censorship, this fight by governments against new technology, as some kind of evolutionary situation which we have to overcome.... We can, in fact, must build the tools of a new democracy.... Technology and science is not neutral. There are particular forms of technology that can give us these fundamental rights and freedoms that many people have aspired to for so long.
</blockquote>

<p>The book ends with a chapter called "The Rat in the Opera House" which, I personally believe, was an experiential metaphor that struck Assange as so significant that he came up with the idea for this entire book to write those last few pages in order to write the last line:</p>

<blockquote>
It will only be a high-tech rebel elite that is free, these clever rats running around the opera house.
</blockquote>

<p>Although it may appear dismal to talk of freedom-loving human beings as rats running around in the opera house of governmental and corporate surveillance, remember: the goal of the cypherpunk is not only to free themselves from the grasping tentacles of censorship and surveillance, but to build tools to enable others to do the same. And to that end, no matter how large the surveillance state grows, cryptography will always be a non-violent weapon in the arsenal of the cypherpunk who wishes to make a difference in the world.</p>

<blockquote>
The force of nearly all modern authority is derived from violence or the threat of violence. One must acknowledge with cryptography no amount of violence will ever solve a math problem.... A couple of individuals with cryptography [are able to stand] up to the full might of the strongest power in the world.
