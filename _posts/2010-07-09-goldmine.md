<h2>Discover great applications in the Android Marketplace that you never knew existed!</h2>

<h3>Better than a "Top 10 Best Android Apps" app: this is a tool to help you find the best apps for *you*.

GoldMine helps you dig deep and find valuable apps currently buried deep within the Android Marketplace.

Dig for Apps with GoldMine!

You can download GoldMine in the Android Marketplace by <a href="market://details?id=com.konreu.android.goldmine">tapping here from your Android phone</a>, searching for "gold mine" from within the Android Marketplace, or using your Barcode Scanner to read the QRCode to the left.

<p>GoldMine helps you find content within the Android Marketplace that simply does not make it onto the "Top 10" or "Best Of" lists. These applications are still valuable, they are just burried!</p>

<p>Using GoldMine, dig through applications quickly until you find an application that you find valuable. When you install the newly-found application, you have struck gold!</p>

<p>GoldMine tracks both your valuable "gold" applications (those you have installed) and the applications that you did not find valuable: "pyrite" = "fools gold".</p>

<p>Use the icon in the notification bar to quickly dig for another app -- no need to go back inside the GoldMine application!</p>

<p>Configure your preferences and choose whether to include paid apps, free apps, or both. Also choose which categories interest you, and un-check those categories that you do not wish to dig through.</p>

<p>GoldMine is both a tool, and an app to pass the time. Have a 5 minute break? Dig through apps and see what's hot and what's not.</p>

<p>Share applications -- both "gold" and "pyrite" -- with your friends. Sometimes, these apps are just too good to keep to yourself!</p>
