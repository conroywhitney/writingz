title: Just Ask Why
---

w-h-y? Or in Espanol, ?por que?

So easy to say; yet can lead to the most interesting things.

I remember asking this of my dad when I was a kid; supposedly one of those things that four year olds like to do. Where the kid asks a question like "Why is the sky blue?". The parent has a decision. If they're feeling particularly lazy or ignorant, they'll say something like "Because it's reflecting the ocean"; or if the the parent is particularly religions, they'll just say "Because God made it like that"; or if they're particularly Socratic: "Why do *you* think it's blue?"; or if they're particularly sarcastic: "Because it's not green."

When the kid is baffled by the simplicity of the answer (because they innately know it must be something bigger, involving chemistry and refraction), they ask "Why?" over and over until they feel like they are getting a close approximation of the real answer. It's tolerated for a while, until the parent loses their patience and just answers: "BECAUSE, GODDAMNIT!" That'll shut um up. Just hope it doesn't shut them up for their whole lives.

Bizniz executives are proud of asking "why". Indeed, there's a whole cult of "The Five Whys" that supposedly is one of the marks of a good manager. It goes something like this: it's not enough to know WHAT, you need to know WHY; and you can't just know the WHY of the WHAT, you need to know the WHY of the WHY of the WHY of the WHY of the WHY of the WHAT. Example: We can't meet our quota. Why? Because we don't have any of this item in stock. Why? Because we didn't manage our stock well. Why? Because we don't have the necessary software tools to do our jobs correctly. Why? Because you're always telling us to do more with less. Why? Because you're a shitty fucking company to work for, that's why, now go suck a dick; I quit.

See? That's how good managers get to the source of the problem. The problem is that that person was a bad employee who was saying bad things about the company all the time. And then the manager gets a promotion for having high morale because nobody else will say anything bad about the company anymore. Win!

No but seriously: asking "why" can lead to the most interesting things. So ask it more often. Why? Because, goddamnit!
