I am currently reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c86H36mgiM4C&lpg=PP1&dq=think%20and%20grow%20rich&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false"><em>Think And Grow Rich</em> by Napoleon Hill</a>. I found this paragraph too good to not post, but too long to tweet:

<blockquote>Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose of money, wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not recognize failures, will bring riches</blockquote>

I think that is about as simple as it can get. Any questions?  =)
