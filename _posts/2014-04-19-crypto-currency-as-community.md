This post is in reference to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHrjs7VkSGU">Andreas Antonopoulos: The Future Of Crypto-Currency</a>. There's a <i>lot</i> of information there. Even though it's almost 30 minutes long, it's totally worth checking out.
</p>

<p>
Andreas starts this talk by addressing concerns stemming from misconceptions that many people (including myself, before this lecture) have today about crypto-currencies, namely:
<ol>
<li>How many crypto-currencies are we going to end up with?</li>
<li>How will we keep track of them all?</li>
<li>And, more importantly, which one is going to win out?</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
To address the first question, Andres proposes that since anyone can create an alt-coin for any reason whatsoever (such as Doge-coin), that we will likely end up with hundreds of thousands of different currencies. The purchasing power of the currency may vary (e.g., how many eggs can you buy with it); that would be entirely dependent on the concept on which the currency is based. But that's the point: since you can base it on anything, there is no limit to how many different types we will end up seeing. Andreas gives the example of a class of 5th grade students creating "Joey-Coin" and "Susie-Coin", which end up being a popularity contest of which person is the coolest in the class. How many eggs you could buy with a Joey-Coin is another question altogether. But the take away is that trying to control or otherwise limit the creation of new alt-coins would be counter-intuitive to the core concept of crypto-currencies, so we're going to have to learn to live with it.
</p>

<p>
So how <i>will</i> we keep track of them all? To answer this question, Andreas proposes that we will have wallets and exchanges that are able to calculate exchange rates between currencies. I am free to hold on to whichever types of currencies that I wish; but to use them, I might have to exchange them for another form at whatever the going rate is. This is no different from traveling abroad, though. In Peru, many businesses accept the Nuevo Sol, USD, and sometimes Euros. But if you have other currencies, you must first exchange them before use. Andres goes on to hypothesize that we might even have some baseline currency, like the LIBOR or the S&P or the CPI, which might be used to describe the exchange rates between currencies. Not to control or peg currencies, mind you, just as a useful expression of relative value. Right now we compare the "price" of BitCoin as relative to the USD because many people are still thinking of BTC in the old model as an "investment", rather than in the new model as a useful form of purchasing power. When that changes, so will our way of thinking about relative value of alt-coins.
</p>

<p>
But the main point that Andreas addresses in this talk is about this misconception that certain currencies will win out and become the new de-facto replacements. He likens this unto the idea that for a long time, you had to rely on major, authoritative newspapers or magazines to learn about a particular current event. Still, even today, we mostly get our news from "main stream" sources. This almost monopolistic control of content stifled discussion, disseminated incorrect information, or sometimes even allowed for downright manipulation of the public. When blogging became popular, with the whole new "Web 2.0" in the early 2000s, you began to have thousands of people discussing topics from different angles. The choice of what information you digest became a vote of sort for that particular blogger. News became less top-down and more bottom-up.
</p>

<p>
So just as what we read became a vote in how we see the world, so which currencies we use will be votes in how we want society to be. This means that by using a given currency, we are part of a community who expresses the same values and politics. People who believe in inflationary economic policy will use an inflationary currency. Those who believe in a gold-standard will use a fixed currency. Andreas gave the example that we could have charity currencies that take a fraction of a percent of each transaction and use it towards some social good like homeless shelters or planting trees. Which currency you use is no longer the result of where you live or what you do. It's a conscious choice that you make; a vote; a decision to engage with a certain political, philosophical, economical, or social ideal. Or to not engage; that also is your choice.
</p>

<p>
These currencies will exist alongside each other; they will not be competing, per-se; but will complement one another in the same way that other forms of communication media do today. Andreas points out how communication today shifts between different media almost seamlessly: conversations between you and someone else may use texting, voice calling, video chatting, emailing, and (heaven forbid) real in-person, face-to-face talk-talk. Each form of communication has its own strengths and weaknesses; and each complements the other to some degree.
</p>

<p>
When you choose a particular medium (like AIM back in the day, or Twitter / Facebook / LinkedIn more recently), you are choosing to belong to a particular community with whom you wish to communicate. You use Twitter to talk with people on Twitter; you use Facebook to talk with people on Facebook. You can use both; and you can talk with some of the same people on both; but their uses differ; what you communicate differs; and how you communicate it differs. Similarly, choosing which alt-coins you hold and use will express a desire to associate and transact with individuals who also use those coins. There's no better example of this than <a href="http://juggalocoin.org/" rel="nofollow">JuggaloCoin</a>: an alt-currency for person-to-person transactions within The Family. Important to note: don't buy that coin if you're not a Juggalo. They take that shit seriously, bro.

<p>
I said Andres' talk covered a lot, didn't I? So one last thing, and that is this idea of sovereignty. We all know money and power are related. In the past, power created money. But now money can be created, and then people give it power by using it, and then the people can use that power to whatever ends. So now money becomes the tool and we are the masters; rather than today, where money is the master and we are its slaves. I'll end with a direct quote from Andres at the end of his talk (about 24 minutes in) that addresses this in a more eloquent way:
</p>

<blockquote>
Currency, in the end, is really a form of language; it's a language by which we communicate our expectations and desires of value. Now that we can do it on such a massive scale -- now that everyone can create currency -- our choices will really matter.

We're past the zero-sum game. This isn't about nation-states anymore. This isn't about who adopts BitCoin first or who adopts Crypto-currencies first; because the Internet is adopting crypto-currencies. And the Internet *is* the world's largest economy; it's the world's most populous economy; it's the first trans-national economy; and it needs a trans-national currency.

What we've really done, is we've inverted the very basic and most fundamental equation of currency which is: that for millennia, until the year 2008, sovereignty defined currency. Sovereignty was the basis upon which currency could be created. And that currency allowed that sovereignty to be expressed. The monopolistic control of currency *is* the basis sovereignty.

And now the Internet has a currency. And the Internet is going to use that currency to create sovereignty. After 2008, currency creates sovereignty; and the Internet has its own currency. Which means the Internet has purchasing power; which means that the Internet has economic freedom; which means that the Internet can exert economic freedom in a post-nationalistic way; in a way that ignores borders and makes the nation state -- not obsolete -- but simply less relevant.
