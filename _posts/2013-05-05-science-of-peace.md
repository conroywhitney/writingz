In order to write what I write, I do what I have always done, but then
do something different that I might not have done if I was not doing
what I decided to do. That said...

Today, was totally different. It might have been the best day that I
have ever had. But yesterday was different, too. So, overall, there is
nothing to report, as I have too much to report.

If I have learned anything about my life so far, it is the interesting
interplay between so-called opposites. Most obvious is the way that
males and females interact. But the concept extends in an outward radius
from the point of focus. Concepts that are male and female, like: in and
out, up and down, towards and away, for and against, black and white,
positive and negative, life and death, right and wrong, tyrrany and
freedom.

Moving backwards from that list, the very last, 

"right and wrong", has
been discussed for millenia amongst people who would like to call
themsevles scholars, or religious students, or free spirits, or
bleeding-heart libertarians. You don't know wrong until you do it; and
you don't know right until you feel it. I personally think the whole
discussion is moot; our realities, shared as they might be in some
senses, don't very much overlap all-in-all. So if we do what we want,
without hurting anyone else, nobody (by definition) gets hurt. But the
trouble arises when we start to think that we know what is best for
other people; and the trouble gets even worse when we start to make that
person do what we think is best for them. That's the difference between
tyrrany and freedom. Yes, Obama, or Bush, or Clinton, the Older Bush, or any other
president was elected according to the system that we have set up -- by
ourselves, and for ourselves -- and "brought them to power".

What's so crazy to realize, though, is that -- because of our two-party
system -- we are constantly divided. One term, 51% of the population are
happy(ish), and 49% are distruntled. That's no way for a group of people
to behave.

Divided is an interesting word, though. I look at the root "vide", or,
maybe in Spanish, "vida", which means "life". The "di" would be latin or
greek or something for "two". And in English, the "ed" means past tense.
That means that to have a "country divided", something cause our lives
to split in two.

We know what that was. And it's not a story that's unique to human
history. Indeed, it's the same story over, and over, and over, and over.
We have made choices that have caused us all to drift apart from each
other.

But the good news is that we don't have to be scared about. In fact,
it's something that's quite funny. In our "social experiment" called
life, we have discovered things that we each believe about "the way
things should be". The funny part comes when we realize that our
"answers to life" are not the same.

Some people take this as a serious offense to their own person. They
think that when someone believes something diferently than they do, that
the other thing is an offense to their thing. They don't stop to realize
that that might be exactly how the other person thinks. And that's where
the root of all injustice comes from. We don't often enough stop think
about how the other person might think or feel. We are so quick to
consider the Other as "other".

That's exactly the opposite point of what we should be doing in life. We
should be instead thinking about how we can learn from each other about
how life *really* is. Because to say that there is only "one real way"
to this thing that we somehome decided to share in common called "the
afterlife" -- when you start saying that there is only one answer to our
collective question, you start to be a bit crazy.

Perhaps it's just the postmodern / generation-ebay-napster-google-etc in
me, but the best example of "live and let live" is on the Internet. It's
like its own separate continent in some other dimension that we can't
perceive. In this alternate-dimension, people are both very kind and
helpful, and extremely shitty and lame. But it doesn't matter. 'Cause
it's the Internet. It's not real. It's just what we decide to say when
we say it, because we can, because it's not real.

But more and more, this new dimension is being conquered by the same
ignorant, selfish, rude, and intolerant ideas that have already spread
to control the dimensions we already occupy whenever we are not "in" the
Internet.

We all know that the Internet is not real life. Or is it? Could we be
considered "dating" if it is not "Facebook offical"? Can what internet
sites I visit define me as a person? If I post a picture of something,
does that make it mine? These are all things that we are trying to find
out, collectively, what we think. And it will take some time. Computers
and the Internet have evolved so quickly, and we are still on the same,
slow-growth trajectory spiritually, philosophically, and politically.

Personally, as a person, I can't say exactly what I believe, one way or
the other. Only in the middle of a conversation, in a very specific
context, can I say that I am for or against something; that I believe it
is "good", or "bad"; or "right or wrong".

I put those last ones in quotations because I (recently found out that I
might just maybe might) have a Daoist streak in my worldview. If you
look back at some of the things I've written, (especially considering my
divorce and my way of coping before and after), you might notice. Well,
I didn't.

Not until I read the recent "The Trolly Problem is Not a Problem for a
Daoist". That's one of my favourite (read: one of few) philosphical
questions that I have actually taken to thinking about. (Another is the
determinism problem.) But in the article I read, it talked about
"non-action". My contrary is that "non-action" is itself an action. And,
I argue, any true "Daoist" would understand this.

The way I understand Daoism, is that we are all participating in "The
Way". The Way is not set, in the sense that it was predetermined. But
it's also not totally controllable, like The Matrix. It's
just The Way, man. Like "The Dude", from "The Big Labowski". From the
surfers I met, I think they understand The Way in a pretty chill way.
You're just a surfer riding on the surface of this uncontrollable,
natural, primal force, and getting to enjoy The Ride.

We all know George Carlin, the "joke" where he's talking about "it's
just a ride; and some pepole want to get off this ride". It's a
rollercoaster that goes up and down. Sometimes you feel totally small,
and powerless, and lonely, and depressed, and you don't know what you
want anymore, and you're not even sure if you want anything at all. And
then sometimes you feel grateful to be alive, and jealous of yourself
for being able to be doing what you're doing; like if you heard the
story of you, you'd say "I want to be him!".

But the wave we ride by definition has both extremes. Without it, it'd
be a lake placid. And it's because of those ups and downs that we are
able to experience the thing for which life exists in the first place:
ecstacy.

I heard a surfer from Costa Rica describe it best: the moment when you
catch a wave, and you realize you have gotten the balance that you need,
and you're now in "surfing mode", where you need to remember everything
that you have ever learned, both about how to stay on the board, but
also how to appreciate the moment that you are in so that you can
appreciate the absolutely, incredibly, amazingly, joyfully, honestly,
fortunate lives that might have ever been lived.

And here you are, sitting at your computer; and how fortunate are you?
Have you thought about it? Really considered that there has been nobody
like you before, and there never will be again. We may have shared
themes in our lives -- which is a very important thing to realize, by
the way -- but we are each living out an existance that is so unique, in
the sense of nobody else lives it; but a cool thought is that we also
get to shape it.

So as you're reading, and (I hope appreciating) what you are doing, and
where you're doing it, and with whom you might be doing it, I hope you
take a moment to think about what led you here. How did you end up doing
what you are doing right now, where you're doing it, with whom you're
doing it. Is there anywhere else you'd rather be?

Correct answer: No.

Yes, we all wonder about the opportunities that we have passed up;
different futures that might have but never were. And it's that last
part that is important to think about. They never were. That's my own
personal solution to both the Trolly Problem and Determinism.

And the answer is Surfing.

We are all on a wave and get to go in one direction or the other. We
choose one way, we stay on the board. We choose another way, and we
might wipe out. We only live what we live. So whether we have the best
surf of our life or the most baudacious (sp?) wipe-out ever, that's what
we live; that's all we know.

We get into these discussions about "well, what if?", like some future
that we are so vain to project. In the Trolly Problem, is the cliché
"what if the guy you save turns out to be the next Hitler". Puhleeeeze.

(btw, that é is important to be able to know how to type; on Windows
it's ALT-0238 (yeah, really, right?); and on OSX it's Option-e to get
the accent line, then you can type e, or a, or o, or whatever other
letter needs that forward-facing accent (yeah, really, right?)

But the "next Hitler" question exactly proves the whole Daoistic (sp?)
idea: you just, plain, don't know. But not just that: it doesn't, even,
fucking, matter. The wave ("Way") we are riding is what it is, because
of what we have done, and what we will do. We could not, and should
not(, and shuld not want to be) doing anything else, anywhere else, with
anyone else.

I've actually dealt with the Trolly Problem in my own personal life.
Both my dog and my friends' dog were running down the sidewalk towards a
busy road. I only had time to save one of the dogs. I don't feel I had
time to "choose" what I did, I just did it: I saved their dog, and, as a
consequence, my dog was hit by a car and died within the hour. I don't
regret that decision. I can't. To do so would be to say that what "it
is" is not what "it should be". And I can't personally say that.

All I can do is be grateful for where I am, and what I'm doing, and who
I'm doing it with. (Or, Grammar Natzi's (another Hitler reference
(*cough*)) with whom I'm doing it.) The decisions I made have led me to
where I am right now, and that place is part of The Way, so it is Good.

That night, when I lost my dog, I realized that I made multiple
decisons over that night, or evening, or afternoon, or morning, or the
previous day, or the day before, or the weekend before, or the weeks
before, or the months before, or the years before; that led to that
exact situation where I lost what I lost. I'm not trying to sound
cliché, it's my own quick index scan over decisions that I made that I
can see affecting being where I was, what I was doing, with whom I was
doing it.

I used to be a bit adverse to telling this story, but now I understand
that it is exactly the story that marks who I am, more than any other.
But it has a background that cannot even be told in a single setting.
Even as I'm listening to the words "die young and save yourself", I
realize that who I am today is such a product of my own experiences --
based on my own decisions -- that it makes entire, total sense why the
present exists.

And as much as I want to want to be able to regret, I really, just:
can't. I am able to experience the emotions of regret, when I let
myself, and believe me: when I do share stories that are special to me,
I do so with the highest confidence; and the sharing helps me. But more
importantly, after I do share, I no longer feel that crazy sense of
crazyness that in English is called "emotions". It's the "sharing"
period that encapsulates all the pent-up emotions that are a part of me.
But more and more, it's the experiences that I let flow through me that
are becoming a more important part of my life than the things that I had
let take such a great part of me for so long.

I'm listening to a youth favourite, which defines a lot of who I am. I'm
going to type their lyrics as a sort of catharsis:

<pre>
I'm heaven sent; don't you dare forget
I am all you've ever wanted; what the other boys always promised
Sorry I told; I just needed you to know

I think in decimals and dollars; I am the cause to all your problems
Shelter from cold; we're never alone
Coordinate brain and mouth
Then ask what it's like to have myself so figured out
Wish I knew

I hope this song starts a craze
The kind of song that ignites the airwaves
The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are
With whomever they're there with
This is war
Ever line is about something that I don't want to write about anymore
I hope you come down with something they can't diagnose; they don't have
the cure for
Holding onto your grudge; oh, it's so hard to have someone you love
Keeping quiet is hard; cause you can't keep a secret if it was never a
secret to start
At least pretend you didn't want to caught

(Chorus)
We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, but we're throwing the fights
I jsut wanna believe
I just wanna believe

In us

Oh, it's so controversial

We are entirely smoothe
We admit to the truth that we're the best at what we do
And these are the words you wish you wrote down
This is the way you wish your voive sounds
Handsom and smart

My tongue's the only muscle in my body that workds harder than my heart
And it's all from watching TV
And the speeding of my breathing
Wouldn't stop if I could
Oh, it hurts to be this good
Holding on to your grudge
Oh it hurts to always have to be this honest with the one that you love

[Chorus]

This is the crash only we can bestow
This is the price you pay for a loss of control
This is the break in the bend
This is the closest of calls
This is the reason you're alive
This is the rise and the fall

[Chorus]
</pre>

I could keep going with other lyrics. Well, I mean, if you ask me to:

<pre>
So this is odd
Painful realization
That all has gone wrong
That nobody cares at all
And nobody cares at all

So you burried all your lovers' clothes
And burned the ltters lover wrote
But it doesn't make it any better
Does it make it any better?

And the plaster dented from your fist
In the hall whre you had your first kiss
Reminds you that the memories will fade

So this is strange
Our side-stepping has come to be a brilliant dance
Where nobody leads at all
Where nobody leads at all

And the picture frames are facing down
And the ringing from this empty sound
Is deafning and keeping you from sleep

And breathing is a foreign task
And thinking's just too much to ask
And you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights

Well this inredible
Starving
Insatiable
Yes this is love for the first time
Well you'd like to think that you were invincible
Well, weren't we all once
Before we felt love for the first time
But this is the last time
This is the last time

This is the last time
</pre>

I'm not one to randomly quote song lyrics (EDIT: yes, yes, I am), but I
will comment on the fact that it's these songs that are so
representative of the life that I've lived; and to think, that these
songs were a part of my life before all this ever transpired.
Back-to-the-Future aside, it does bring back around the idea of the
Trolly Problem and determinism.

So our previous stance was that a Daoist might or might not have a
problem with that Problem. And that's exactly it. Whatever you decide is
what you decided because you decided it. Your decision is not outside of
The Way -- it can't be. By definition, The Way is just, like, you know,
The Way, man. Whether or not you decide to switch the trolly's course,
it's The Way. You made the decision you made because of every other
little, itty bitty, seemingly-inconsequential decision you, or anyone
else you knew, or anyone who in some way was able to affect your life,
and the ones who made the decisions that somehow influenced their
decisions made. It's like counting drops of water in the wave (The Way).

Why count?

It's The Way.

So no -- don't choose inaction because the way it is is The Way. That's
not the way to think about The Way.

Make your decision, given what you have to go off of (off of what you
have to go?), and do it! Don't just stand there wondering what you
should do, if it's "The Way" or The Way. You don't *know* The Way, so
you can't even guess. All you know is what you know, so do what you need
to do. *That's* The Way.

And don't worry, even knowing about The Way when you make your decision,
is The Way. It doesn't matter, dude. But at the same time, it matters as
much as anything else that was ever decided matters.

And once you get that, you can then move on to the (now-trivial) question
of determinism. The question of whether or not we have free will; and
whether or not free-will is something that is pre-determined. What we do
is what we do, and it's all a part of The Way.

When I think of The Way, I envision a donut ring, in 3D, like just out
of the Krispy Kreme conveyer belt. Nom. It's a giant, self-referential,
perpetual, multi-threaded loop that repeats itself in different
scenarios over and over -- no end, that's just what this.

There's no use trying to escape it -- that's all there is -- there's
nowhere to escape to. But why would you even *want* to "escape"? If you
start tryhing to do something other than what you're doing right now,
maybe you could start appreacting how wonderful it is to be a part of
the loop you're in. Instead of wondering about what might be outside of
the loop, you instead appreciate what's in the loop.

And on top of that, appreciate that what you are experiencing and
deciding within the loop is at the same time defining what the loop is.
You may not have been able to do anything different in the past, but you
are still able to do something differently in teh future.

To me, as a non-Daoist, who just happens to maybe think similarly to
someone who might call themselves a Daoist, I have to say, that that's
what gets me by day to day. For all the things that have happened in my
life, "good" and "bad", I still reject those terms as too arrogant to
even use. What was is The Way, and what will be will be The Way as well.
I could think about what I might have done differently in my life, but
that would be mental masturbation; I can't change it. I can only change
what will be.

One of the best lessons I have learned by watching someone else live
their life is that: I can't change how other people behave; I can only
change how I behave. It's a very important lesson in the context of
their life, where they were married to a manic-depressive. It leads you
to a sense of self-empowerment in the face of hopeless abandon.

Like that wonderful line from Two Towers, Helms Deep, "What can Men do
against such wreckless Hate?" It's the same answer every time: whatever
you can, and feel you need to, do.

Something that's always bothered me about both Spanish and German is
"hacer" and "machst" (respectively). In English, they mean "to do".
"Do", being a verb that implies a state of creation. In Spanish, "hacer"
means "to do" as well as "to make". In German, "machst" is "to do" or
"to make" as well. Why only one word? Perhaps you could argue that
"doing" or "making" are the same. But I think the distinction lies in
the idea of routine or creative acts. "Yo hago el almuerso" ("I make the
lunch") is different from "Yo hago last trastes" ("I do the dishes"). Or
maybe I don't understand either Spanish or English haha.

But whatever we do or make, it's done, and we learned something from it.
What's the last thing that you did that you could either undo, or didn't
learn from? What's funny is that that could be taken in (at least) two
different contexts: when was the last time you did something with such
dismissal that you no longer grew from it; or that you did something
that you knew you shouldn't do, and will probably do anyways again.

I might hope to be unable to answer either of those questions. But it
also is something that I might be blind to because of my worldview.
Learning is key. And, obviously, accepting the decisions I make based on
what I've decided.

So here I am. Either the best day ever, or the worst mistake ever. And
that's the decision we get to make every time that we do anything. And
the best news of all is that, whatever we decide, whether we might in
retrospect consider it "good" or "bad", "it is what it is". We "could
not", "should not", and "would not" have made any other decision.

So is there anyplace you'd rather be?

No. Because I am where I am because of the decisions I (and countless
others) have made. And I am happy here. What I'm learning, both "good"
and "bad", are all a part of The Way.

Would I switch the tracks? I don't know. I could only know in that
specific context. There are a thousand many reasons why I might or might
not do it. But whether or not I would, it is all a part of The Way. I am
still responsible for my action, non-action, or in-action, but still,
that was on me, and I did (or did not do) what I did (or did not do).

Do I think that what I do was only a consquence of the decisions and
circumstances of the past? Yes, but I still got to decide. Every
decision is a new opportunity to ride The Way towards ... what? I don't
know. But it's not something that everyone is able to find their own
peronsal balance on.

Or, at least, I haven't found mine -- yet.

But I'm optimistic.

Which leads me to my favourite Spanish translation ever:

pasciencia = paz + sciencia

patience = the science of peace
