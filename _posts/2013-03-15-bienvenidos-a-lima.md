 title: Bienvenidos a Lima
---

I love humidity. I wish I could always live in a place where I sweat
even though it's 70 degrees because it's so humid. (*major sarcasm*).
Although, actually, I
*have* lived in a places like that (\*cough\* Atlanta \*cough\*). But I'm talking about Lima, this
time. Humididty is like my kryptonite. When it's humid, I sweat. When I
sweat, I become uncomfortable. When I'm unconfortable, I can become
pissy. And when I'm pissy, ain't nobody's havin' a good time.

Well, so far, I am -- having a good time, that is.

Three things have stood out to me about Lima thus far:

* The gas station called "VIP USA"

* The PHD (Pizza Hut Delivery) with speed-flames on the "D"

* The St. Bernard statue which is used to store dog poop bags

What I've really noticed is how I am now comparing everything I see and
hear here in Lima to similar things in Guatemala. It's actually kinda
absurd how I am trying to compare them -- and I am finding it hard to
stop. Maybe they are so similar that it's not possible to not be
reminded of the other. Kinda like learning Portugese after learning
Spanish. I tried that once. It made my head asplode.

One of my favourite phrases is "Two is a ridiculous number" from
Asimov's "The Gods Themeselves". Take it in this context: right now, we
only know about life on Earth, so for the time being, we can say that
"Life only exists on Earth." But as soon as we find life on another
planet, say Mars, we can no longer say "Life only exists on Earth and
Mars." Why not? Because if there are two, why not three? And if three,
why not four? And so on and so forth until, when you take it to its
mathematical extreme, it reaches infinity. So you can only say "Life
only exists on Earth." or "Life exists on an infinite number of
planets." (assuming there are an infinite number of planets). It doesn't
mean it exists on ALL planets, just that we can no longer assume that it
doesn't exist on a planet just because we haven't found it yet. Cause
that'd be crazy.

So how does that idea translate to things in our personal lives, like
cities we have lived in, or relationships we have had? "Two is a ridiculous number [of times
to get married]." When someone has gone through a divorce and then
gotten remarried, you know that the rest of the people around them are like
"Uh huh... how long is *that* gonna last?" They assume that because a
person has had two spouses, that they will continue divorcing and
re-marrying until they die, because that's obviously just what they do
now.

In contrast, people assume that the longer first-marriage spouses
are married, the more likely they are to stick
together for the rest of their lives. I guess in some senses that may be
true: maybe they've learned how to work out problems; maybe they have so
much pride that it becomes harder to admit they failed; maybe they
becomre more afraid of making such a big change as time goes on.

For whatever reason, the "more likely to stick together" logic has
always struck me as a bit naive -- like in 1984 when people would buy
lottery numbers close to the number that had just won. Just because
something worked at one time doesn't mean it will continue to work. In
fact, chances are, it's less likely to do so over time.

Entropy always wins out, in the end.

I hinted at it earlier, but maybe the idea is to stop trying to compare
the old thing vs. the new thing -- whatever that thing is: city,
relationships, brand of underwear, whatever. I mean, unless it's edifying,
and helping you to understand the new by using the context of the old --
which I guess in the case of underwear it would be.
Otherwise, it seems to me like maybe you are not giving the new a fair
chance to impress you for what it is.

Maybe you need to realize that the new and the old are not better/worse, they are just different. And while
mathematically "two [might be] a ridiculous number", it doesn't have to
work that way in our personal lives. It's OK to have second-of-two, or
third-of-three without it seeming like it's lessoning the value
of prior
versions, or somehow going to go on forever until you get
one-over-infinity which we all know approaches zero. Not to be confused
with infinity-over-infinity, which of course would be one.

I guess my point is: live in the now. If
you find something new that makes you happy, just be happy. Try to catch yourself when you start
thinking about it in the
context of similar priors and ask yourself: is this conscious and
constructuve? Let *the new* surprise you for what
it is, not disappoint you for what it is not.

And above all, just be **grateful**: for the past, the present, and the future.

I know I am.
