 title: Safety Blanket
---

I bought a *manta indigena* today in Lima -- a blanket made out of alpaca hair like what you would expect some tourist in Peru to buy. I sought mine out -- indeed, it is the only thing I wanted to buy here. I could see it in my mind -- what I wanted it to look like (black and grey, surprise surprise); how big I wanted it to be (curl-up body-sized); what weight it should be (warm, but not bulky); what texture it should have against my skin (soft, but not tickly). All I needed to do was sit back and let it come to me. And it did. It's perfect. It's the right everything. I couldn't ask for anything more.

It's my new safety blanket. Yes, I am a grow'd-ass man, but in some ways I'm still a child; believe me, I realize that archetype is alive (although maybe not well) within my life. But specifically, I feel that for the next 24 hours, I am going to appreciate my safety blanket as much as any 4-year-old kid would. Why? Because I am about to do something which scares me; which I know will cause me pain; and which may end up being one of the more important experiences in my life.

I am going to participate in an Ayahuasca ceremony.

I am going to describe what that means, and why, and all the other questions that may be rising up in your head. So before
you start Googling and stumbling upon misinformation, or (worse yet), real accounts of people's experiences, please take the time to read and absorb the information in these hand-picked, precisely-ordered resources that I'll link to in the next paragraph. If you don't understand what it is, it's history, and it's realities, we won't have any common ground on which to base any further discussion.

[Ayahuasca is a powerful tool for physical, emotional, and spiritual healing and awakening](http://www.know-thyself.org/ayahuasca.html). I am participating in this ceremony because I want to experience what Ayahuasca has to teach me -- or [what I can teach myself through the use of Ayahuasca](http://www.biopark.org/peru/ayatherapy.html). I have been preparing for this experience [spiritually for years](http://blawg.konreu.com/2011/03/09/quantum-zen/), [mentally for months](http://blawg.konreu.com/2012/12/19/the-day/), and [physically for the past week](http://www.biopark.org/peru/sqcleansing-01.html). While it is a drug, it is not addictive and indeed [is being used to treat addiction](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/07/25/psychedelics-for-drug-addiction/). While it's [physically safe](http://www.biopark.org/peru/Ayamed-precautions.html), it is [physically, emotionally, and spiritually exhausting](http://www.warriorpoet.us/2012/07/11/double-dragon-a-return-to-ayahuasca/). (Warning: that last link might be a bit too graphic if you get squeamish easily)

This Ayahuasca ceremony is the main reason that I came to Peru when I did. Yes, I have doubts about whether or not I am ready, but actually, I think that is a sign that I'm ready. You know the phrase: only the insane never doubt their sanity. If you read through all of those links (which I hope you did, and not just the first paragraph of the first one), then you are no doubt questioning whether or not I know what I am getting into. I'll cut to the chase: no way, Jose. Part of the Ayahuasca experience is that it is never the same for anyone, ever. What I do know is my motivations and my current state of mind/spirit going into this, and that, from what I understand, is ultimately the most important part.

I do not take this ceremony lightly. In fact, as I have said before, I am actually quite scared. But that fear is the primal fear: fear of the unknown. It's also fear of anticipated pain. [It's also very normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Ra7cVkUoE). This ceremony will not be a walk in the park. There will be emotional pain, just like with a therapist, as I unpack much of the baggage that I have been carrying around with me for my whole life, and especially in the last year. There may be physical pain as I purge toxins that have been stored up in my body from years of abuse. There may be spiritual pain as I wrestle with the last vestiges of the religion into which I was indoctrinated before I was able to think for myself. These experiences may be painful, but I also know that they will be temporary.

Thankfully, the positive parts, the results of the trial-by-fire, so-to-speak, are lasting. A healthier, happier me who has met parts of himself that he never knew existed. Stories and lessons of the connectedness which I know to be True, but which I yearn to feel in my heart and to live every day. New and refreshing perspectives on life and my purpose in it. These are my intentions going into this ceremony. I wish to be a better, more-fulfilled me in order to be a part of a better, more-fulfilled Earth / Human Experience.

I know that this is the right timing for me, partially because of the way-leads-to-way path that I'm on where doors keep opening and closing, leading me in a given direction: here. It wasn't until a week ago that I knew this opportunity was possible; and it wasn't until a couple days later that I acknowledged that this was the path I wanted to take. As I said to a friend before coming here: "Funny how that works, right? How I have to give myself permission to let things work out well for me; or rather, I have to overcome my self-imposed barriers in order to move forward."

For me, that's what this trip (double entendre) is really about. It's a journey inside myself to clean out my proverbial closet; be infinitely grateful for my existence right here, right now; and to look forward down the multivariate paths that I can lead, and ask myself on which one I can be really, truly happy. If I were able to have one question answered through this experience, it would be: [What question should I ask?](http://www.skeptictank.org/files/aj/42.htm)

All I know is that I'll be glad to have my safety blanket with me. It's really quite neat.
