<h2>Discover the best apps in the Android Marketplace that do not make it on any Top 10 list.</h3>

<h3>Just like real roulette, you may see a few losers before you win big.

Later versions will give recommendations based on apps you like.

Take a chance on a new app, with AppRoulette!</h3>

You can download AppRoulette in the Android Marketplace by <a href="market://details?id=com.konreu.android.approulette">tapping here from your Android phone</a>, searching for "app roulette" from within the Android Marketplace, or using your Barcode Scanner to read the QRCode to the left.

<p>AppRoulette helps you find content within the Android Marketplace that simply does not make it onto the "Top 10" or "Best Of" lists that some people publish. The applications that AppRoulette helps you find are still valuable, they are just buried deep within the Android Market!</p>

<p>Using AppRoulette, play a few rounds until you find an application that you find valuable. When you install the newly-found application, you have a Winner!</p>

<p>AppRoulette tracks both your valuable "Winner" applications (those you have installed) and the applications that you did not find valuable: "Losers".</p>

<p>Use the icon in the notification bar to quickly play another round while you are inside the Android Market -- no need to go back inside the AppRoulette application!</p>

<p>Configure your preferences and choose whether to include paid apps, free apps, or both. Also choose which categories interest you, and un-check those categories that you do not wish to have recommended to you.</p>

<p>AppRoulette is both a tool, and an app to pass the time. Have a 5 minute break? Play a few rounds and see if you win any great new apps.</p>

<p>Share applications -- both "Winners" and "Losers" -- with your friends. Sometimes, these apps are just too good to keep to yourself!</p>
