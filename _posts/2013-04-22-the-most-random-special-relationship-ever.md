title: The Most Random Special Relationship Ever
---

We all have those people in our lives that we will remember for as long
as we shall live. It could be a relative, or a good friend, or even a
person we only ran into once but who touched our life in such a way as
to make their memory something special and precious to hold on to. There
have been a couple of people like that on my journey so far. Good
conversations about spirituality, philosophy, or politics (my three
favourite things to talk about: why are we here? what should we do while
we're here? and how should we do it?) But
sometimes it doesn't even have to be about anything in particular: they
could just be really great people who you miss when they are gone but
who will always have a special place in your heart.

Two such people just left my life (for now). I had the opportunity to
follow them onward and forward. I thought about it for a good amount of
time while listening to a pan-flute band and eating fresh fruit on the
sidewalk outside the market here in Aguas Calientes. I didn't feel the
same pressure that I usually do when making a choice like this. My usual
love/fear charts for staying vs. going filled themselves out fairly
easily, and it was pretty obvious that I had to choose between fear of
the unknown, and fear of losing something I didn't want to lose. I don't
consider either of those to be valid motivations, so I instead asked: do
I feel like I am done here in AC? No, I don't think so.

I always said the same thing when someone asks me:
"How long will you be here in Machu Picchu?". It's pretty simple, I
explain: until I look up at the mountains and I no longer feel that
overwhelming sense of peace and security that Pachamama gifts to those
who dwell within her realm. It's a very special gift, indeed, as it
wipes away all fear and doubt and leaves nothing but gratitude for the
ability to be alive in such a wonderful place.

My relationship with these two wonderful people started from the ashes
of my previous life. It was the night, just a few weeks ago,
where I was sitting in my hotel room listening to my
train leave -- the last one that could get me to Cusco in time to get to
Lima in time to catch my flight to the States. I heard the train pull
away, whistle blowing, and I bawled my heart out. In between sobs, I
cried out
to the universe and confessed: I have no idea what I'm doing; I'm so
fucking scared; What the fuck?!

After about 5 minutes of this, I calmed down, composed myself, and
decided to go for a walk. It was twilight, the city was alive with
energy, and the mountains were reassuring me that I had made the right
choice. I immediately felt a sense of peace that I had made the right
decision to stay. I still had no idea what was to come, but I knew that
I had chosen the right path for me. The mountains told me so, and I
believed them. They were the ones who let me know that this is my place,
at least for now.

I met these people in the most serendipitous ways throughout our shared
time here. We never exchanged any contact info, or ever went looking for
each other. We just always found each other somehow, and were glad to
spend some time talking and laughing whenever we were able. On the
surface, our lives did not seem to have very much in common. But always,
beneath each of our encounters, there was an undercurrent of energy and
connection that spoke of some potential shared future.

The first time I saw her, she was talking with a cop who seemed to be
telling her she was not allowed to sell her hand-made jewelry. She makes
beautiful fucking jewelry out of leather, died in wonderful gradients,
with painstaking patterns etched or embedded. She hasn't been able to make
any recently, though, because she left her tools back in Argentina. I
guess the cop was just doing his job trying to protect the local market
interests, but at the time I could only think two things: one, how
incredibly beautiful and other she was; and two, how obviously she's
just trying to get by, like everyone else, so I don't see why the cop
has to be mean to her.

After that, we would meet randomly here and there. Have a few
conversations. Have a few laughs. Have a few dances. It was the most
easy-going relationship I have ever had. The best of friends never have
to say goodbye, because they know they will see each other again
eventually, and pick up the conversation where they left off. It was
that way with us, though I don't even remember what sorts of
conversations we had. It doesn't matter. Just spending time with them
was enough for me. There were times when we didn't see each other for a
few days, and we would both be thinking that the other had left, and
laugh, and be glad that we were together once again.

She is quite petite in stature, which does not do justice to the
strength and endurnace she has both physically and spiritually. Always
about her is an aura of feminine strength which both makes you treat her
as an equal human being, and make you wonder what an execellent mother
she might make one day. Her medium-length, angular haircut frames her
face in such a way that Picasso would be proud to claim credit for. Her facial expressions
are in constant flux, shifting seamlessly from smile to laugh to pout and back to smile again. Her smile-lines ripple out from her eyes
and lips in all directions, like a pebble thrown into a glassy lake. When she laughs, for just that moment, all the problems in the
world no longer matter because the source of her joy drowns out all the
fear and negative thoughts of all of the people around her. When I look into her eyes, I forget where I am
or what I am doing, and can only feel gratitude for that special
moment that I get to spend lock-gaze with her. When she dances, she is
carefree and silly, relishing in the relationship between the music and
her body and inspiring others to try to attain that same level of
ecstacy. She told me something special about life, the night before she
left, while we were dancing, which, from now on,
whenever I get down, I will remember when and where and what she told
me, and everything will be OK in the world again. And no, I'm not going
to tell you what it was. Not now, at least. =)

He is the sterotypical hippy guy. Long dreads, scruffly face, unwashed
body, worn-out clothes, earring, and always a huge grin on his face. I never saw
him frown -- ever. He was the most easy-going person. Everything he says
is always with a slight chuckle, as if it was the most amusing thing to
be able to think and talk and have conversation. It's like he always
had some inside joke with you, about nothing in particular. I only ever heard him be really
serious once, and that was to tell me something special about life --
encouragement that when, in the future, I feel like I've lost my way or
that I cannot keep going, I will remember, and it will give me the
strength to perservere in my journey. Again, my secret, for now. =)

They left yesterday afternoon. I ran into them randomly after buying
some fruit, so I plopped down and shared some, and we talked. They told
me they were leaving, and asked if I wanted to come. I really did want
to. Maybe I was scared about leaving with such short notice. Or maybe I
felt like I wasn't ready to go yet. I'm not sure. I decided to stay, but
not without a sense of sorrow. But that sorrow has melted away into
anticipation for the next time we meet, wherever and whenever that might
be. I know that day will exist sometime in the future, because we all
want it to happen, so it will. Until then, we're going to be living our
respective lives down whatever paths they take us.

But the feelings of love and joy and peace that we shared together --
that's what's real in life. And those memories will be with me for the
rest of my life. So while I look up at these mountains, and feel a
twinge of pain in my heart because they are no longer nearby, I still
feel the reinvigorating spirit of Pachamama soothe my soul, I have
nothing left but gratitude for the time we got to spend together, and
hope for the future when I run into them serindipitously again.

And we'll pick up like nothing ever happened.
