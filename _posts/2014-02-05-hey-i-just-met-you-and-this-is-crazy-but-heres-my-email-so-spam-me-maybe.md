We've all been burned providing our email address to websites. Maybe you did it out of the best intentions: wanting an e-book; or a set of tips sent by email; or simply just to get past a content gate. But you always know, deep down, that your inbox is going to hate you for subjecting it to yet another onslaught of poorly-targeted "email blasts" or other such spam.

Have you ever been linked to a blog post where, before you can even get a chance to read the first sentence, a modal pops up asking you to "SUBSCRIBE TO OUR BLOG SLASH NEWSLETTER! FOR THE WIN!". You don't even know who they are, or what they do, or what other type of content is on their site. There's no way in hell you're going to give out one of your most guarded public secrets (your email address) to these complete strangers.

<b>So if you are so wary of providing <i>your</i> email address, why do you expect your users to?</b>

Don't ask users for their email address at the expense of them being able to actually use your site. It's a turn-off, and they're not going to convert. Instead, how about asking them in a CTA at the bottom of the article? And how about, instead of it being "Subscribe! Subscribe! Subscribe!", perhaps it can be "Learn more about X Topic You Just Read About." Imagine that. Email subscriptions targeted to the type of content they are interested in.

<b>tl;dr</b> Yes, ask for emails; but be classy about it. You might just end up with higher value leads.</b>
