title: Adrenaline Junky
---

Before today, I never would have
considered myself an "adrenaline junky"; my actions on my way home
from work this evening, however, would speak otherwise.

Do you know that feeling when you're speeding on the highway?
When you're going, let's say, 75 mph in a 65 mph. And for some reason,
or no reason at all, really, you decide to push it to 85
mph. Your heart starts beating a little faster. Your thought process
speeds up a bit. You
start making excuses up in your head for when (not if) you get pulled
over. 85 mph is not so bad, is it? Surely, officer, you could understand
how a normal person might find themselves going 85 mph in
a 65 mph without any malicious intent, right?

Having explained yourself to your imagined authority figure, you feel like you've already gotten away with something. It feels good. You
figure: why not? So you continue on to 95 mph. You realize that you won't be able to
talk your way out of a ticket now; it is obvious that your speeding is
intentional. Your start to feel butterflies in
your stomach as the adrenaline begins to take effect at the anticipation
of future confrontation. Your senses are heightened, scanning for signs
of danger. You are now doing two things at the same
time: trying to keep control of your vehicle as you fly past other metal
boxes full of humans; and
trying to look as far as possible down the road for any signs of your
archnemesis: highway patrol. You
know that a rational person would say "enough, you've had your fun", reduce their speed, and merge
back into the slow lane. But you're not thinking rationally, anymore.
Your id *likes* this feeling. It goads you on: you've gone this far; you
may as well keep going. In for a penny, in for a pound. Do it. You know
you want to.

So you do. You gun it past 100 mph and keep climbing to 105, 110, 115 mph... You feel alive. If your hands weren't gripping
the wheel so tighty, they would be shaking from the energy coursing
through your body. You are no longer worried about speed traps. All you
are focusing on is not hitting other cars, and not veering off the road.
You feel every bump as if you were an olympic skiier going over a series
of moguls. Every
micromovement of your hands on the wheel sends your car twitching sharply in either
direction. You know that you are balancing precipitously on the brink of catastrophy, but you don't care. It
could all end in a fiery crash or in a 5 year jail sentence, but none of
those possibilities matter at the moment. The past and the future no
longer exist; there is only the present.

See what I mean? Adrenaline junky, #amirite?. I never realized it though, until
this afternoon. I wasn't speeding today, though. That whole story had
nothing to do with my actual actions. It was just a thought experiment.
In fact, today, I was driving precisely the
speed limit, on a normal route, on a completely normal day, feeling more
or less the same as I always do. Except for the butterflies in my
stomach. And the increased pulse. And the heightened senses. The sure
signs of adrenaline.

Today, on my way home from work, I got a wild thought into my head. I
continued past my regular turn-off and started taking a route that used to be second
nature to me. I had driven that way literally hundreds of times over the
past decade. It had been years since I had done it, though, and for a good
reason. People live there whom I onced loved, but whom I have deeply wronged. And I did not care to
run into said people, for fear of... of what? I'm actually not sure.

Every mile felt like I was trespassing; like I had jumped over a fence
right by a sign that said "Private Property. Owner will shoot on sight."
For some reason, in my head, there was this invisible barrier that I
felt I couldn't cross. That if I crossed it, then alarms would sound, and I
would be confronted by the people that I was not sure if
I was ready to face. Maybe that's why I did it; maybe, subconsciously, I
wanted to finally face them to put my fears to rest.

But no alarms went off. My past never caught up with me. As I passed what would normally
have been my destination, my body decided it no
longer needed adrenaline to prepare for the anticipated danger of
my imagined meeting. As I sunk back into my seat, windows down,
feeling the room-temperature Spring air, watching the sun set behind
newly-green'd mountains, I felt like I had accomplished something tremendous and
noteworthy. Moreover, I felt alive, in the real sense of the word. My past was behind me (literally);
My future, ahead of me (figuratively); and for that moment, all that
mattered was the present.

And in the end, isn't this all that there is?
