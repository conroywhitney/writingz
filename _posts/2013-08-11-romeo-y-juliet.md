 title: Romeo y Juliet

"It's a love story; baby, just say 'yes!'"

Do you know that feeling? That micro-black-hole that forms in your
chest? It's the strangest sensation, that I have never bothered to look
up why it actually feels how it feels... Some people hate it and try to
avoid it; I don't (often) seek it out, but I always recognize it, and
use it as an indicator of certain sentaments that I am experiencing.
Gah, how robotic a way to say "feelings"...

I get that feeling when I listen to "Romeo and Juliet" by that chick
who everyone was like "wahaaa??" (Taylor Swift). Why? Well, first of
all, she was incredibly talented for her age... Oh, wait, different
"Why?"

Well, first off, it's because R&J
is a classic love story; star-crossed lovers based on a foundation that
only n00bz would mistake; miunderstanding derived
from miscommunication; dramatic
gestures which totally surpass any amount of reasonableness; etc. But it was also adapted to the screen by Baz Luhrman,
staring Leo DiCaprio, etc. And that movie represents a time in my life,
with certain people, and certain backstories...

...and *that* is what creates the black-hole in my chest. It's not the
song itself, nor the archetypal story, nor the contemporary film... it's
that particular set of circumstances which, upon reflecting, somehow
leave a painful residue in my corpus.

I am only conjecturing here, as to why, but perhaps: perhaps it
represents something negative: a time of injustice; or a time of
mistrust; or doubt; or perhaps, it represents something great: a time
that I miss, or wish I had participated in more, or would like to have
again.

Or maybe all of the above. I don't know why we are so set on this idea
that reality has to be one thing and one thing only. If reality is
subjective, subjectivity means "no holds barred" (which I also don't
understand that phrase).

But take this -- you experience something: something great. And you are
so grateful for this great thing. And then that great thing experiences
something not-so-great, and you, the grateful one, are now also tainted
by the un-great thing. And then you think: well, if this great thing is
no longer great, then my gratefulness is no longer so grateful as well.

God, does that make any sense? No, I don't think it does. When you have
your great thing for which you are so grateful experience the un-great
that exists everywhere in this life, it's a moment to be even more
grateful, that you were able to be there to support her during the time
when she felt the least worthy, but when you were also able to realize
how incredibly worthwhile she is.

Ooops. I guess I switched pronouns there.

It's OK to feel like the vicarious victim by hearing (entiendando) the
experiences of the actual victim; but never, ever is it OK to feel like
an actual victim because of how the actual victim's experiences affect
you.

And back to R&J, that's what makes the tragedy: the supposed actual victim is,
according to the ploy within the play, Juliet, who feigns death for blah
blah blah... but Romeo shows up, and becomes a vicarious victim, who
goes too far in his role, overreacts, and becomes an actual victim. But
ultimately? it's Juliet, always and forever, who is the real victim:
whatever choice she had, she could not control the actions of others;
and thus, in the end, she no longer had any choice regarding her own
actions.

And that's the real lesson here: don't. do. anything.

Cuz trying is the first step towards failure.
