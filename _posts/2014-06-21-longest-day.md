title: Longest Day
---

Today was the Summer solstace which is by definition the longest day of
the calendar year. However, it was also, for me, quite a long day
subjectively as well. I woke up at 04:30am this morning. It is now
03:30am on 2014-06-22. Yep. Long day.

Instead of recounting everything that I did today, I want to instead
throw back to [a blog entry that I wrote a year
ago](/2013/06/21/shortest-day/). At the time I would have
been working at the hostel in MaPi. I forget in which capacity. I also
forget the context for these ramblings other than that I was obviously a
bit tipsy. I would like to revist and recontemplate these musings in my
current context in an effort to clarify where my feet are today compared
to a year ago. I expect this to be quite edifying.  :)


---------------------

    I still have more to learn. I think here. But maybe not. But who ever knows, right?

Wow. Understatement of the century. Thinking back to this time last year
-- I could not even *BEGIN* to see the things that I was needing to
learn. Between then and now, I learned an incredible amount about
myself, who I am, how I function, what I want, what I *don't* want,
frugality, disclipline, sobriety, confidence, friendship, love. So many
stories had then yet to unfold. As I am in my current situation, I
should remember that until the ride is over, there will always be more
to learn, and that I can not even begin to predict what those things
might be.

    earn 'a living' off of having land which others pay me to use

Throwing this one in here because I am currently working in the Real
Estate industry which a year ago I was harping on pretty bad. I remember
bringing this discussion up with someone who I considered wise, about
"property rights" and "ownership" and I felt I was being quite smart.
The person did not address those topics, they instead simply mentioned
that "I am asking the wrong question" and left it at that. Working now,
as I have, in this part of society, I see that it's not the inherent
permission-of-use-or-assignment that is amoral, but the artificial
dividing line drawn between owner and user that arises necessarily from
our current form of capitalism. That's all I'm going to say about that
for right now.

---------------------

    The decision to hold yourself accountable for your own mnistakes [sic], interests, and whatever else not that you might want to keep out of the rain of the consequences of that which you once thought was wise, but which, with age, has tought [sic] you that wisdom is not something that comes with age, but with experience; and you, listening to the rat, scared, dancing, contra to what you believe; that is what you must not fear; it holds no power over you but for what you give to it.

Sometimes you have to jump in with both feet. Sometimes the signs say
"no diving" and you shouldn't dive. But sometimes the pool is intended
for you to be able to dive without killing yourself. Sometimes you're up on the high
dive, and look down, and know you can, and feel you want to, but a part
of you is scared. So you step back from the edge, and look down the
ladder, and consider climbing back down. But you did not come all this
way to wimp out; and you realize this is your only chance to do this in
quite this fashion. So you step up to the edge once again. You gaze at
the horizon. You marvel at the different perspective being up here gives
you. You smile, and relax, and breathe deeply. You look down just long
enough to pick your target point in the water below, and you jump...

---------------------

    you are who you are because you did what you did; and you are going to do what you are going to do through the miracle that we call consciousness; and that the lessons that you learn are exactly what you needed to learn: no more, no less

It's OK to make any mistake once. The idea that a mistake is something
"wrong" or "bad" is an unfortunate concept that I grew up with. I
instead would prefer to say that the effects of a choice might be
"unpleasant" or "unsatisfactory"; but as long as I learn something from
it, I cannot regret it. Often, the things I regret most are the actions
I do *not* take for fear of failure. How can I learn if I remain static?
I must "move forward, not backward; upward, not
forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!"

---------------------

    to know someone as you never are quite sure you might ever know someone again: to know that that is possible; to actually feel that which you had one time felt

I remember this thought very well. I remember thinking that what I had,
I might never have again. I felt lost in a cold forest. I was not sad,
or bitter, or guilty; I was hopeless, and self-doubting, and lonely. I
am glad to report that since then, I have learned that I need not feel
that way ever again. It is indeed possible to meet someone and feel that
way again. I know this, because I have done it. It does not matter how
it ends, it matters only that it was possible. The possiblity itself is
what provides the value. Everything else is a bonus.

---------------------

And last but not least, these are 5 questions that I proposed as a way to
bring myself back to peace. I remember coming up with these in the
context of alternatives to the usual "Where are you from?" and "What do
you do?" questions that were so frequently asked. Instead, I suggested
that we probe deeper into who we are as human beings. I see them now in
a more metaphorical light.

    1)  Why are you right here, right now, having this conversation ?

I am right here right now having this conversation because I was again
feeling lost, and lonely, and full of self-doubt. I was fearful, and
bitter, and worrying about the future. I was not content with my
world or the people in it. I realized that it's because I have not been
content with myself. I have been letting this fear sink its talons into
me instead of letting it roll of my back like water. I have been
allowing myself to give into unhealthy coping mechanisms because I see
myself as too weak to soldier on without them. But I am strong enough. I
can do this. I know this is true, because otherwise, I would not feel
like this is the right place to be, at the right time, and the right
thing to do. So I am going to do it; I am going to be the best me I can
possibly be.

---------------------

    2)  What is one fear you have been holding on to ?

The fear of failure controls my life more than any other single entity.
This fear is closely linked to my grand-scheme-of-things fight-or-flight
response. When I am restless, irritible, and discontent, I have a
tendency to feel like the answer is running away and starting over. It never is. Failure
will continue to haunt me until I either prove it wrong by overcoming it (in which case,
there was nothing to fear in the first place) or I prove it right by
failing (in which case, no need to be afraid anymore, because failing
isn't so bad after all!).

  *"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my
fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has
gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has
gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."*

---------------------

    3)  What is one hope that you have for the future ?

I hope to stick around and actually see this life through. Like a
character roll at the beginning of an RPG, it may not have everything,
and there is definitely room for improvement, but the balances are
acceptable in the areas that matter to me. To continue re-rolling at
this point would just be inane. I feel like I am on a roller coaster.
For the past 6 months, I have been going up the hill click, click,
click. I reached the top in the last week or so, and hear the tell-tale
*thunk* of the chain letting go. I am in that last moment of stillness
before the ride begins in earnest with the initial freefall. This is
going to be incredibly exciting. I just need to remember that **it's just
a ride.**

  *"The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you
choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our
minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills
and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's
fun for a while. But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we
can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work,
no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between
fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your
doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of
us as one."*

---------------------

    4)  Describe someone with whom you thought you could have kids ?

I have to admit that I got a little bit of whiplash recently from this
one. 6 weeks ago I saw myself as forever-single (not to be confused with
forever-alone). I had come to enjoy that I was able to take care of
myself. That I could find balance in my life to do the right amount of
things I wanted to do, and the right amount of things that I *had* to
do. I had a 5-year plan that included work, travel, and graduate school.

And then I met her. And somewhere in that conversation I went from
forever-single to wanting to be a father. The latter feeling has come
and gone in my life depending on the strength and intimacy of my
relationship. To feel that with an almost-complete stranger worried me,
just a little bit. I do not feel ready right this moment, but then, who
really ever is until they need to be?

But enough about me. The question was about *her*.

She is confident. During our first conversation, she said what she
thought without a hint of needing approval. She took a gap year before
college to live abroad even though her entire social circle tried to
convince her otherwise. She knows that her body is a tool to be
respected, but that she is more than just her physical self. She will
help show our children what it means to be themeselves; to be comfortable in their own
skin, and do not take the harsh judgements and criticisms of the world
as anything more than just someone else's opinion; that ultimately, it's
our opinions of ourselves which mater most.

She is intelligent. She consistently surprises me with her thoughts.
I realized she was a keeper during our second conversation during which
we discussed everything from the Muppets to Baudrillard before switching
into conversing competely in Spanish about what it's like to be a gringo. Many hours
passed and it was early morning before we were willing to surrender to
the reality of the time of night. The bredth and depth of her knowledge
and interests will help show our children that this world has many neat
things in it; that life is pretty rad; and that if you keep an open
mind and open heart, anything is possible.

She's funny. She takes the serious things seriously, but also knows when
to poke fun at them as well. I do not remember a time in my life where I
smiled and laughed quite as much as I do these days. If I were to repeat
any of the things that bring me such joy, you would not understand. And
that, I believe, is kind of part of the point. We have a shared sense of
humour. I don't expect you to get it; but it tickeles my funny bone in
just the right way. She will bring
a sense of wit and humor to our children that will help show them that
this world is not to be taken too seriously.

She is creative. Her imagination is an entire existence in-and-of
itself. In that game, where you go in a circle and each participant adds
one sentence onto the end of the story, and the story progresses from a
single sentence, into a full story -- hers are the sentences that bring intrigue, surprise, and plot twists. I know that she will
instill in our children a sense of wonder that the world will never,
ever be able to beat out of them, no matter how hard it tries.

She is caring. Her nature is one of genuine empathy. She is able to put
herself into someone else's shoes to consider how they might be feeling
in a given situation. This spills over into physical nutruting as well.
In one of my fantasies involving her, I see her putting an imaginary bandaid on the
knee of a little blond-haired boy after kissing it all better. I know
that she will always be there to listen to and care for our children
physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

She is beautiful. I often see different versions of her depending on
what type of moment we are sharing together. Some times I see her as
twice her age, with smile lines three times as deep, and she represents
a life lived joyfully. Some times I see her as innocent, others as wily,
and yet others as simply present. One particular night in my memory, she
and I were walking together and I had a vision of her being many months
pregnant with our child. She was round and waddling, but radiant
and feminine and serene. I would like to see that vision come to pass.

She is strong. As much trial and hardship and questioning and growth
that I have gone through in the past 18 months, she has done as well.
Similar situations, but on the opposite sides of the table. She was able
to be honest with herself when her situation was no longer healthy. She
made the tough decisions and took the necessary actions. She walked
through the valley and came out the other side a changed person. She has
been through the crucible, and what is left is a strong and able woman
who does not need anyone. Instead of our relationship being based on
mutual need and mutual weakness, we can base it on mutual desire and
mutual strength. Our relationship of mutual respect will be an
inspiration to our children as they look for qualities in their friends
and future partners as well.

She is inspiring. She has a zest for life that I have never known
before. It's not the typical focus on career, nor consumerism, nor
hedonism. It is the simple yet deceptively difficult concept of living
and loving life. It is a mindfulness and a sense of presence. She does
not dwell too much on the past, nor plan too much for the future. Her
spontenaity and willingness to try anything once inspires me to be the
person that I know I can be. I see her inspiring our children to live
and love life. That is, after all, a significant reason why we would
have children in the first place: to give them the chance to
experience how nature is neat, and life is rad.

Just a few thoughts. You know. As an initial starting point.

    5)  If you had a way to get one, single message out to everyone who is either alive, or will be alive in the future, what would you tell them?

Seek ye the truth and ye shall find it.
