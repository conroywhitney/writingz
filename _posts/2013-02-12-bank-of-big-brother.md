title: Bank of Big Brother
---

The first day that I started traveling, I tried to use my ATM card in Mexico City and it was blocked. Thankfully, at the time, I had enough cash on me (I was just getting more while killing time). If I didn't, though, I would not have had any recourse to fix the situation. I didn't have a working telephone. I didn't have access to the internet. I would have been stranded in a foreign country without access to my funds.

To prevent that issue in the future, I recently tried to ensure that my Bank of America account would not be blocked now that I am out of The States. First of all, I resent that this is necessary in the first place. When I travel, I have really only two people I absolutely *need* to notify: me, and the person who is helping me travel (plane, train, bus, etc.). I *choose* to notify my family and friends, because I care about them and want them to know where I am (and that I am OK). 

What I find *absurd* is that "my bank" (using the possessive is just such an oxymoron) in actuality takes precedence over my family in friends. Now, if I want to travel, I *have* to let "my bank" know about where I plan to go and how long I plan to be there. That's a kinda difficult thing for me to do in my current situation, where even *I* do not know the answers to those things up until the moment that they actually manifest. 

What I find most insidious about this "relationship" is that I do not have a say in it. As a "most highly valued Bank of America client", I can either accept their status quo, or deal with the consequences. I guess there is a third option -- change banks. I usually like those "taking the bull by the horns" options, but in this case, I think that this 3rd option of changing banks is actually a mirage. I guarantee that if I were to switch to Wells Fargo, or Chase, or any of the other big banks, or, I dare to say, any other bank at all, I will be met with the same choice. And thus, it is not really a choice.

I remember it was not but 8 years ago that this concept of "[Fraud Protection](http://www.bankofamerica.com/creditcards/index.cfm Bank of America Total Security Protection)" was a new feature that was being introduced to the credit cards and bank accounts that I had. In fact, Capital One used to try to charge me like $50 / month for it. Now, you can't opt out of it. In this person's opinion, if you can't opt out of something, it's no longer a feature, it's a shackle. It is yet another way for banks, corporations, and governments to be able to invade my privacy without my permission (and no, I do not consider using a bank to be tantamount to waiving my [4th amendment rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution 4th Amendment of the US Constitution).)

Why such heavy rhetoric? Perhaps the ever-present issue of mining and profiting from my personal data just gets my goat when I realize just how much of a hostage I am to it. In this case, BoA has figured out my purchasing profile (where I live, what stores I go to, how much I usually spend there, how much money I withdraw, per day, per week, per month) and has defined a rut in which I am supposed to stay. I am welcome to deviate from that rut, but at the cost of having my account blocked. I am then welcome to call and "apologize" for doing something unusual if I want to have access to my money again.

And isn't that the underlying issue, here? Is it not my money that I am letting them use for their own profit? Indeed no: it is their money that they are letting me use for my own debts. And when they are unsure about how I am using it, they require me to explain myself and ask permission to continue using their money.

Am I bitter? You bet I am. Why? Because it is small paradigm shifts like these (that it's their money, not mine) which poke holes in the illusion of our supposedly "free" society. We have had our power and natural rights usurped through fine print and promises of security, falling prey to the [foot-in-the-door compliance tactic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique Foot in the door technique). By complying with their immoral rules and participating in their corrupt game, we are acknowledging and giving credence to the very thing which we detest most. We fail to recognize that we *can* take our ball and go home; and in situations like these, that is exactly what we should do.

"[To all you free market, healthcare robbing, stock stealing, retirement fund
fucking with niggas](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/immortaltechnique/richmansworld1.html Rich Man's World)" I say -- go fuck yourselves. Leave us the fuck alone. We're not playing your fucking game anymore.

P.S. Just for kicks, I am including the un-edited transcript of my chat with the Bank of America Platinum Privileges® Specialist. I always make sure to remain cognizant of the fact that the person on the other end of the chat (or phone call) is just doing their job, and are not personally responsible for whatever issue I am taking with the company. At the same time, however, I hold them personally responsible for continuing their employment with the company they represent if they really do realize and really do apologize for the injustice the company represents. "I'm just doing my job" is not an excuse for immorality.

	Conroy: Hello
	
	Cerisa: Thank you for joining Bank of America's Platinum Service Chat! My name is Cerisa. May I ask who I have the pleasure of chatting with today (full first and last name)?
	
	Conroy: Conroy Whitney
	
	Cerisa: Hello Mr. Whitney! Thank you for being one of our most highly valued Bank of America clients! How may I assist you today?
	
	Conroy: Thanks Cerisa.
	Conroy: I went out of the country without letting you guys know first.
	Conroy: I tried to use my ATM card in Mexico City on Saturday Feb 2nd
	Conroy: It was denied
	Conroy: I am now in Guatemala
	Conroy: And would like to be able to use my card
	Conroy: Are you able to help me?
	
	Cerisa: Thank you. What are the last four digits of the card number in question?
	
	Conroy: Let me check, hold on please, just a moment.
	
	Cerisa: Certainly.
	
	Conroy: XXXX
	
	Cerisa: Thank you. We are not showing that card as blocked. It is currently open and active.
	Cerisa: I will be more than happy to notate your account of your travel plans.
	Cerisa: What are the exact dates you will be traveling and specific countries that you will be visiting during your trip?
	
	Conroy: Not sure about the dates, or the countries
	Conroy: OK, so no idea why it was blocked in Mexico City last-last weekend, then ?
	Conroy: As long as it's currently open and active, and I won't have any problems, then I am happy.
	
	Cerisa: We  will need to notate your account of your travel plans in order to avoid it from being blocked in the future. We will need to know the dates you are traveling and the countries you will be vistings.
	Cerisa: visiting*
	
	Conroy: I don't have specific dates or countries planned.
	Conroy: I would prefer if there was simply a no-block note on my account
	
	Cerisa: How long will you be in Guatemala?
	
	Conroy: So that I do not have to notify you each time I decide to continue in my travels
	Conroy: I do not have a specific timespan that I will be in Guatemala
	
	Cerisa: Regrettably, there cannot be a "no-block note" on your account.
	Cerisa: You would need to notify us so we can notate the account of your travel plans.
	
	Conroy: How about a "traveling abroad until further notice" ?
	
	Cerisa: Regrettably, no.
	
	Conroy: I'm sorry, but I do not wish to need to notify Bank of America each time that I decide to continue my travels.
	Conroy: I let my family know, and my friends
	Conroy: I feel it is absurd to have to let BoA know as well.
	
	Cerisa: I understand. In this case, the card may be blocked in the future.
	
	Conroy: That's unacceptable to me
	Conroy: It is my money
	Conroy: It is my journey
	Conroy: If I say it does not concern BoA, it doesn't
	
	Cerisa: You can contact us directly at 1.877.833.5617 or 1.602.597.2395 (International Collect), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, if your card is blocked.
	
	Conroy: Please know I am not angry at you
	Conroy: What other options do I have ?
	
	Cerisa: There are no other options.
	
	Conroy: Except to get to an ATM, find out I have been blocked from accessing my funds, and am unable to contact the phone number (I do not have a telephone)
	Conroy: In this case BoA will be responsible for leaving me stranded in a foreign country without access to my funds
	Conroy: Because I did not let them know beforehand exactly where I am and how long I plan to be there
	
	Cerisa: You can provide us with the dates and countries that you will be visiting in order to notate your account so we know that you will be making purchases or withdrawing funds in those countries.
	Cerisa: This is a proactive procedure for the safety and security of your account.
	
	Conroy: I would like to waive this proactive procedure
	Conroy: I wish to remove that "feature" from my accounts
	
	Cerisa: You are not required to provide us with your travel information; however, your card may be blocked and you will then have to contact us to verify charges and transactions.
	
	Conroy: I have safety features set up
	Conroy: Such as how much can be withdrawn from or charged to my account on a given day
	Conroy: And if I am no longer in control of my card, I will for sure let BoA know ASAP to shut the card down
	
	Cerisa: Your daily ATM withdrawal limit is $XXX and your daily purchase limit is $X,XXX.
	
	Conroy: Thank you for letting me know that.
	
	Cerisa: My pleasure.
	
	Conroy: I am going to lower those
	
	Cerisa: I know your time is valuable; is there anything else I can assist you with today?
	
	Conroy: But what I do not need, and do not want, and would like to opt-out of, is the "proactive procedure" wherein BoA blocks me from accessing my funds
	
	Cerisa: Certainly.
	Cerisa: You are not required to provide us with your travel information; however, your card may be blocked and you will then have to contact us to verify charges and transactions.
	Cerisa: You can contact us directly at 1.877.833.5617 or 1.602.597.2395 (International Collect), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, if your card is blocked.
	
	Conroy: If my card is blocked, and I do not have access to a telephone, what are my options ?
	
	Cerisa: You can call via internet software such as Skype or Google Talk.
	
	Conroy: And if I am unable to gain access to the internet ?
	
	Cerisa: Those are your only options to contact us. All of this can be avoided, if you were to provide us with your travel information so we can notate your account that you will be using the card in those countries for those dates.
	
	Conroy: I'm sorry, but I reject that my two options are to either 1) potentially find myself stranded without access to my funds because I have been blocked by BoA, or 2) treat BoA as if it were "family" and let it know of my whereabouts and travel plans at all times
	Conroy: I will request, again, that BoA does NOT block my funds for ANY reason without my EXPRESS permission
	Conroy: Aside from the limits on purchases and withdrawals which I have indicated
	
	Cerisa: We do apologize. While you are traveling we will continue to monitor your account. There may be a need to place a temporary hold on your card if we suspect there is suspicious activity. This is part of our fraud monitoring for all of the cards we issue.
	
	Conroy: Am I able to waive Fraud Monitoring for my accounts ?
	
	Cerisa: Regrettably, no.
	
	Conroy: So Fraud Monitoring is not really a feature for me, the customer, then, is it ?
	Conroy: If I am unable to opt out of it
	
	Cerisa: Yes, it is. It offers: Zero Liability Protection. If your card is lost or stolen, Bank of America reimburses you for any fraudulent card transactions up to the amount of the loss, when reported within 60 days from the statement date. Guaranteed credit. Your account will be credited by the end of the next business day for fraudulent transactions if your card is lost or stolen.  Fraud monitoring. Card transactions are reviewed so we can quickly identify abnormal patterns to block potential fraud and safeguard your account.
	Cerisa: This is all part of your Total Security Protection that protects the customer ***and the bank***. [emphasis mine]
	
	Conroy: Am I able to opt out of Total Security Protection ?
	
	Cerisa: Regrettably, no.
	
	Conroy: Could you help me understand, by defining "abnormal patterns" ?
	
	Cerisa: That would be purchases or transactions that are out of your normal activity for the account.
	
	Conroy: How do you determine what is considered "normal activity" ?
	
	Cerisa: That is determined by your previous purchasing and transaction history for the account.
	
	Conroy: Interesting. In this case, won't all transactions that I make from now on be considered "abnormal" ?
	
	Cerisa: Yes, they could be since you have not provided us with your travel information so we can notate your account.
	
	Conroy: So I either 1) stay within my same predictable behaviour pattern, 2) let you know when I plan to do something "abnormal", or 3) risk being cut off from my funds for not following #1 or #2
	
	Cerisa: As mentioned earlier in our chat, you can either provide us with your travel information so we can notate your account of your travel plans or you can contact us directly at 1.877.833.5617 or 1.602.597.2395 (International Collect), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, if your card is blocked.
	
	Conroy: I'll take that non-answer as a yes
	Conroy: I know your time is valuable
	Conroy: I will let you go
	
	Cerisa: You are very welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
	
	Conroy: It does not seem like BoA wants to assist me with what I want, but thank you for asking. I appreciate your time.
	
	Cerisa: My pleasure. I appreciate you taking the time to chat with me. Thank you for choosing Bank of America; we greatly appreciate your business. To close this chat session, please click on the Close button in the upper right-hand side of the chat window.
