title: Jesus Does the Dishes
---

So I broke a(nother) beer today. I was closing the bar, doing inventory,
restocking the fridge, and one of the cold beers I had taken out to put
warm ones behind it fell over and smashed. First words? "Fuck me twice
in the fucking face." (If I'm going to swear, I like to do it right).
Last night, when the three beers fell out of the fridge due to both the
way I had them stacked and the rack of human ribs which was placed in
the door (which I still hold was the precipitating cause), I was like (to
myself) "in no way is this my fault." When I told the owner, he didn't
make a deal of it at all, and I felt OK. But tonite, this *was* my
fault. It was an accident, yes, but accidents can be prevented, right?
So when I told him tonite, it was more with an aire of apology. He was
still OK with it, but indicated that I need to be more careful. And that
simple utterance made me think.

I'm not someone who likes to have outstanding debts. When I make a
mistake, I need to correct it, if only for myself. Otherwise, I end up
feeling like there is a rock tied to my foot as I'm trying to swim
upstream; it sticks in the back of my mind for a long time, if not
forever. I guess you could say that my inner peace is disturbed which,
in my humble opinion, is no way to live. So as I am mopping up beer and
glass for the second night running, I decided that for my own sense lf
well-being, I needed to pay for not only tonite's mistake but for last
night's surprise as well. Money means more to me now-a-days than it did
in the recent past, but still: it's not about the money, it's about
making right.

It's like how when I use dishes, I feel a sense of ownership for them. I
cannot stand by and watch someone else wash my dishes. I created this
mess, and therefore it's my responsibility to put it back the way it was
before. I may not do it in the same timespan that other people might
like (and they therefore feel a need to clean them before I get to
them), but never is it my intention to *not* do them. Maybe it's residual Boy Scout morality brainwashing of "leave things
better than you found them", but I cannot abide a debt of that sort. So
brainwashing or not, I appreciate that aspect of my worldview, and have
decided to keep it.

When I was back home a month or so ago, kicking around downtown, I ran
into a number of interesting people throughout the night. I started
following one group around, hanging out and talking, because there was
a guy playing guitar. Not classical Spanish guitar, to be sure. The
phrase used for the genre is "punk rock" or "punk anarchism". My
political and philosophical ideologies tend to lean towards practical anarchism
(see: Robert Heinlein and Noam Chomsky). The lyrics of one song he sung stuck
out to me. The song is "Jesus Does the Dishes" by a guy named Pat the Bunny whilst he was with the
group Wingnut Dishwasher's Union. They go something like this:

> We're kids building models of a world that we might wanna live in.
> And sorting feelings in our stomach
> Is this liberation or starvation?
> But have we made it anywhere at all if the dishes are never done?
> If we can't live without dishwashers, how could we live without cops?
> And you're asking me, who does the dishes after the revolution?
> Well, I do my own dishes now, I'll do my own dishes then.
> And it's always the ones who don't who ask that fucking question.
> 
> Well I don't believe in God, but I'm also not an Atheist.
> Because the universe is chaos, but chaos picks favorites.
> And lately I've been thinking about how I love Jesus
> Because Jesus was a dirty homeless hippie peace activist.
> And he said, "Drop out to find God" to anybody who would listen.
> While turning water into space bags with lowlifes and anarchists.

Having just re-listened to that song tonite while the bar was empty, it
struck me as interesting that aside from feeling a need to pay for the
beers I broke because of my Boy Scout past, I was also thinking
something along these lines: "If there are monetary consequences to
these negative actions, then perhaps I will be less likely to make the
same mistakes in the future."

That thought pattern is especially interesting considering I was just
tonite talking to a Hungarian guy who lives and surfs in Costa Rica. He
was describing the feeling of surfing: how it's a moment of sheer
perfection when you are able to catch a wave. Not only do you have to
have physical balance on the board, but you have to have locational
balance on the wave; and when you achieve both, you feel elated and that
everything is right in the world. He is especially interested in Pavlov
-- you know, the guy who rings the bell and the dogs salivate. People
feel comfortable talking about that experiment because it's about dogs. But we as
humans are affected by the same principle (that was the point of his
research). Given that we all have our own individual bells, the question then
becomes: how many of our bells are we aware of?

So I break a beer, and feel the need to pay for them so that I will
break less in the future. But I'm realizing
that this is essentially the almighty Capitalistic "Profit Motive" in
which I have been indoctrinated kicking in to try to solve a problem.
These incidents were complete accidents, but yet somehow, perhaps if
chaos becomes expensive, I will have a modicum of control over
randomness.

When an entire culture is insane, the sane people are considered crazy,
no?.
