I'm fascinated with how much we all have in common, yet at the same time
how many things are different in our lives or cultures that we can teach
to each other. So I'm working at the terrace bar at the hostel I'm
staying at. I'm essentially a cerveza slinger and minor-league
bookkeeper. The terrace is considered "my office". I spend every evening
from 5pm til close here (I'm here right now, writing) and am responsible for whatever goes on here.
More often than not, great things happen here, where people have
wonderful conversations and get to share with and learn from each other.
But don't confuse responsibility with control -- plenty happens here that is
either unpredictable or above my pay grade to have a say in.

Take tonite, for example. There's a great couple staying here who are from Buenas Aires (note
to self: I need to live there someday -- I've met probably 10 people in
2 weeks from there, and they are all nice as hell). I first met them
when the guy started fiddling with the BBQ we have in the corner. I let
him play around for a few minutes, then asked him if I could help with
anything. In the distinctive Argentinian accent (really difficult to
understand) he implied that he was planning to cook with the BBQ. This
being my first week working here, I am still learning the definition
between "OK" and "Not Allowed"; I still cannot find a consistent heuristic that
approximates that function and allows me to with any degree of accuracy
predict the output given certain inputs. Perhaps I'm missing some variable, such as
the mood of the owner at the time; human nature throws such a wrench
into what might otherwise be a fairly binary decision tree.

So yes, he had asked the owners about using the BBQ, and yes, he was
even encouraged to use it. Why not, right? No skin off their backs! So he
had bought a rack of ribs as big as a human's. Thus began the 4 hour ordeal of cooking his dinner.
Without the luxuries of self-starting charcoal, the source of fuel
consisted of broken-down wooden palates and paper egg crates. It's not
that an easier heat source was unavailable; it seems he was in it just
for the adventure.

That's the funny thing with adventures, though: they are not always
isolated solely to the adventurer. For the first part of the night, he
was scraping the old, wet ashes out of the smoker; enter ashes and soot
all over "my office". Next came trying to light palates with egg crates.
I'm not sure if it's "harder than you would think", cause it sounds hard
to begin with, but to be sure, it was not easy. The end effect was
simply a lot of smoke which the German group quietly enjoying their
beers found both irritating and entertaining at the same time. They
didn't stick around much longer.

He eventually came to
the conclusion that the planks of wood were not flammable in their current
form, so came up with a brilliant solution: use the machete we have in
the bar (why? I've been told it's to threaten the people who won't pay
their tab. Jest? The owners are Columbian -- call their bluff with your
own hide, not mine). He proceeded to split the wood for the next couple hours. The word used
here is *ruido* which means *noisy* or *a racket* -- not to be confused
with *sonia* which is simply *loud* -- though it was quite loud indeed. And dangerous,
besides. Take splitting logs with an axe, now put your fingers in close
proximity, and do it off the side of a terrace. Don't worry -- he's OK.

Somewhere in the middle of this, the German group asked for more beer.
As a *slinger*, that's my cue to enter the picture. Eazy peazy, right?
Wrong. I open the fridge
and out tumbles a cascade of 620mL Cusquenas. I was told about this
exact probablem only
12 hours earlier by a guest who had decided to use the beer fridge for
his soda and was greeted with broken bottles as well. His advice? Stack
the beers in a different way. My advice? *DON'T LET GUESTS TOUCH THE
DAMN FRIDGE*. But that wouldn't have stopped tonite's fiasco, would it
have? Au contraire mon fraire. The story I'm sticking to is that the
precipitating event which led to three lost cervezas was that he decided
to store his raw rack of ribs in the door of the beer fridge. So back to
my advice: *DON'T LET GUESTS TOUCH THE DAMN FRIDGE*. Especially to put
raw meat in close proximity with surfaces that will later be in contact
with someone's mouth. Unhygenic.

This advice is reinforced not only by the two incidents of broken beers,
but also by the fact that sometime between 1am when I closed last night
and 1pm this afternoon when the German group arrived via train and
wanted a beer -- someone helped themselves to a cold one. Most likely
two someones, actually, as there were two glasses for me to clean in the
sink. Upon mentioning to my jefes that maybe we should invest in a lock
for the beer fridge, I was belatedly informed that we already had one.
Suffice to say, the lesson of the past 24 hours is: *DON'T LET THE
GUESTS TOUCH THE DAMN FRIDGE BY LOCKING IT WITH THE KEY THAT YOU NOW
KNOW EXISTS*. Get it? Got it? Good.

So while I am mopping up nae on 2 litres of beer, the BBQ hits the
tipping point where you can see that perhaps, if the winds of fortune
continue to blow favourably, you might actually be able to eat in the
next 2 hours. As he placed the rack of flesh on the grill, I had to ask:
if not human, what type of meat was that? *Cordero*: lamb. Why spend 4
hours cooking when you could just order lamb in a restaurant here? Was
it price? No, he explained: The cuts of lamb they use here in Peru are
not as good as the cuts in Argentinia, so he ordered a special cut from
the butcher and decided to grill out.

One last thing, though: I also had to confess to him
that the first thing that popped into my head when I saw that giant slab
of meat was The Flinstones (you
know, the intro, where it tips their foot-powered car over?). And that's the point of this whole story: did you know that here in
South America, Fred Flinstone is known as Pedro Pica Piedra (*pica
piedra* being something like chiseling). And, he continued, Homer
Simpson is known as *Homero*, which is different from in Spain where
they presumably preserve more of the Americanization of the cartoons.

Funny, right? How we simultaneously have a simiar shared culture
albeit with a localization twist? I'm surprised he even understood the
word "Flinstones". I certainly would not have recognized "Pedro Pica
Piedra".
