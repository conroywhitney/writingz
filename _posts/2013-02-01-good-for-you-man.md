title: Good For You, Man
---

When I talk to people about what I'm doing, I usually get a response like: "Wow, good for you man. I wish I could do that."

What I think they really mean is anything from: "I think you're fucking crazy, but good luck, nonetheless" to "You are challenging my status quo and I do not appreciate it thank you very much."

What is it about exploring and trying new things that scares us? The adage "the only thing to fear is fear itself" is untrue. There are things that I know about that I fear, like nuclear weapons -- in both senses, like "The Fear of the Lord" and "I'm afraid of dying".

And that's the big one, right? Fear of death? A shy second place to fear of public speaking. What does that say about us, that "we would rather be the guy in the casket than the guy giving the eulogy"?

So what is it about breaking out of our comfort zones that scares most people. Derp. Not an interesting question. I chalk it up to fear of the unknown.

What I want to ask is: What is it about staying WITHIN that comfort zone that scares some people? Like me. I experience a sense of existential claustrophobia when two signs start manifesting: I'm not learning and not being as challenged anymore as I once was; and I start to notice how similar things are to the way things have been before. Kinda hard to explain, but you know the phrase "same shit, different day?" Well, to me, that's a sign that it's time to move on.

From others' perspectives -- even the people that I would say know me very well -- they may see someone who can never be happy with the life he has, no matter how great of a life it is by anyone's standards. Maybe someone who jumps from one thing to the next. Or who wakes up one day and says "Everybody! Change places!". But who for weeks or months prior was sullen, moody, and (if you listen to the DSM-IV) clinically depressed.

From my perspective? I have this desire to search out and find The Thing which I was Meant to Do. Perhaps this is a delusion derived from being coerced into taking too many math classes (curse you Cal III; hello Combinatorics!). Perhaps this is me seeing my life as a giant equation (mathematical or boolean) just begging to be solved.

Freud be damned. I'd rather acknowledge that I prefer to believe (note: I'm not saying "there is", just that I'd like to believe there is) a reason for my existence. Something that when I find out what it is, the heavens will open, and trumpets will blare from the skies, and I will know that "thou art god, and I am god, and everything that groks is god." Or maybe it doesn't exist. Or maybe there's two such things. But "two is a ridiculous number."

The phrase "it's not about the destination, it's about the journey" may seem clich√© but think about it in the context of death: it's not about where you go when you die (the purvey of religion), but about what you do when you are alive. It's not about the thoughts and beliefs on which we differ, but those which we hold in common. It's not up to you; heck, it's not even up to me; it's up to us.

Society is a self-perpetuating prison. It's the damnedest thing: we believe what we are told and shown because we believe in the people who are telling us or showing us. How did they come to hold those beliefs? The same way we did: from those before them. Questioning these beliefs is considered "unproductive". 

Case and point: a young man has a goal to go start a social-good organization within a developing country. The road map to get there? A Bachelors in Arts in Non Profits, of course. Consequence? Debt. Solution? Job. Too bad NGOs aren't really hiring right now; for the time being, just get a job in a restaurant to pay the rent. Someday you'll achieve your dream of helping others.

How naturally that flows: well of course; obviously; by definition; everyone knows that; out of necessity; without a doubt. These thoughts we have are assumptions -- we trust them without proof or even probable cause. We take for granted the stories we have been told by those who have been told: school, job, house, retirement = life.

If you want to go help people in a developing country, why don't you just go to that developing country? Do you really need that degree? Do you really realize how much you are plugging into the system that you are trying to escape?

In the same day, I heard two people in different circumstances talking about this same topic: "back in the good ol' days", you could get a job with a single company, have upward mobility, gain prestige, and retire respectably. "Now-a-days", workers should expect to have 8 different jobs and be laid off 3 times. "It's the economy, stupid" is the motto of those who are making an ass of you and me and everyone else who still buys into this.

Why is 8 different jobs considered a bad thing? Or flip that around: why was having a single job for your entire career considered a GOOD thing? Like Ned Flanders: a slice of white bread and a glass of water. This assumption assumes one of two things: that we all know what we want to do for our entire lives as early as childhood; or the mark of a successful life is to make a single huge decision and stick by it no matter what; that whatever your choice, whatever circumstances under which you made that choice, you should stick with it. I'm not going to say that I don't hold a certain respect for people who choose this path; but I also make sure not to offend them too much -- because a man who cannot admit he was wrong is capable of doing awful things.

I do not wish, and I don't think that I will never say, that I would undo what I have done in my past. The very question of "go back and do things over again" to me is moot. Either one of two things happens: either we go back and do the exact same things we did before (under the thesis that we are automatons, and even free will is stimulus-respond); or we make different choices and end up somewhere else with someone else doing something else. And I do not want either of those. I am happy with where I am; with who I am; and with what I am doing. As we learned from Ashton Kutcher, to go back and change your past can completely erase your future.

If you ask me what I think about some things I have done in the past -- that's a different thing entirely. I can definitely point out things that I did that were shitty; or things I said that were unkind or just plain dumb. But to ask a blanket question about changing the past I think is unnecessary, unproductive, and unfair.

So how then should we live? Given that we make our choices with the recognition that our circumstances are vertices in a directed, asyclic graph, wherein we choose to follow a given edge to a different vertex? Very simple: follow your heart. I don't mean thub-dub, but rather that weird feeling you get when you make a decision. Not fear -- ignore fear. But the "Hmm, you know what, I don't think that's what I want" feeling. That is usually (not always) associated with helping you stay on the straight-and-narrow -- like closing your eyes and letting a wind which blows you from behind when you tell you are on the right path, from the sides when you are going astray, and from the front when you need to backtrack and try again. Food for thought: why is the straight and narrow considered difficult to walk? Am I missing something? Shouldn't the curvy, up-hill, muddy, and narrow be even more difficult? Just my opinion.

So what happens when we listen to our hearts and go the direction the wind blows? Well, if we actually resign our control to this wind, we might end up in the road -- always following the wind takes us back to the automaton back-to-the-future thing. We could also always go the exact opposite of the way the wind is blowing -- screw the phrase "wind at your back" -- I'm talkin' about stinging wind in your eyes. But just because our faces are numb and our eyes are crying icicles doesn't mean that we are on the wrong path.

Ya get where I'm going with this? The wind (your heart) can only help you some of the time. For whatever reason, you and I not only possess the ability to follow our hearts, but also listen to our minds. This is what keeps us from blindly walking into traffic because of a translatorial gust. Heart and Mind. When they are working in tandem, beautiful things happen. When they are in strife, it can be difficult to determine the truth: This Sentence Is A Lie.

But the good news is: as long as we are willing to admit that we make mistakes -- and that it's OK to do so -- and that it's OK to change our minds -- we now have a map and compass; a rudder and sail; a block and tackle? that will help us find new directions to explore.

Why are there so few famous explorers like Colombus or Amerigo or whoever else did all that shit back then? Well, first, because the expedition required major financing that few could even dream of affording; a significant commitment from captain and crew for years of their life (and the possibility of losing it); oh, but I guess the point is that there were probably a lot of explorers that we never heard of because they never discovered anything great. Or as they say: history is written by the victors.

So how does this get back to "good for you, man"? Eazy peazy. We all have a Personal Legend (a la The Alchemist) that is ours and ours alone. Nobody can be as good of a you as you can. You can be imitated but never emulated. You can be intimidated but never emasculated. You can be indoctrinated but never lobotomized (unless you were unfortunate enough to be living during that period in the 50s where they experimented on patients in psychiatric institutions -- of to be on Prozac).

Believing that you have a Personal Legend is the first step. You have to feel it in your bones. It has to gnaw at you like a math problem you've spent hours on (and only later find out was a typo). Only then can you start listening to your heart. You need to follow it, trusting it like a hound given at the the scent of a coon. If you lose that feeling (or, let's be honest, you let it get away from you), no worries. You can't get everything right the first time through. We all get second chances, and thirds. Just feel lucky if you get it right the last time!

Where will your bloodhound heart take you? That's for you two to figure out together. Mine has me on a midnight plane to Guatemala. And though I can't see the steps ahead, I can see the steps behind, and I recognize and believe that I am on a path -- my path: my Personal Legend.
