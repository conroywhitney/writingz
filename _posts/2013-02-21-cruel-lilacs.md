Being in my mid-to-late 20s is a trip, man. It's been 10 years since I was in High School. And man oh man, I don't really care to go back there. High School was great, but it was High School. It had thoughts, emotions, and relationships that helped me grow; taught me more about myself; and helped make me who I am today. Yet still, I do not care to re-address the questions and puzzles that I had at that point in my life. I feel that I have learned those lessons and have moved on to greener pastures. I am much more intrigued by the mysteries and connections that I am seeking now than I am by trying to re-experience the advent of my philosophical and spiritual curiosity. 

So it turns out I have a lady-friend here. I would feign ignorance, but it was quite apparent by our second meeting that she was not quite as interested in English tutoring as I had previously thought, but was more just interested in spending time with me. I am very flattered, to be sure; and for what it's worth, I think she's a pretty and spunky kid. And that's just the thing: although we share the same birthday, it's 10 years apart.

But down here, those 10 years are not that big of a deal; the girl in questions has already had her coming-of-age ceremony and culturally is legitimately "on the market" for a serious relationship. Hell, what am I saying? I got married at 18. But still, I feel like I need to treat a "pass" by this, or any other teenage girl, as a serious thing.

I've tutored many teenage girls before, on various topics, in different settings -- but only in the United States. When teaching, I focus on learning in a fun environment -- using the natural energy we create together in order to advance education. Two of my most recent students (in the US), gave me a sweet card that goes in my "read these to feel better about yourself and the world" box -- which I actually kept, believe it or not, even when I got rid of almost everything else I "owned". The card went something along the lines of "we laughed a lot and learned a lot; so thanks." They also gave me Godiva chocolate; an inside joke that made me feel like I had accomplished something.

I have always said that who I am at any given moment is, to some degree, a result of who I am around at the time: my thoughts, diction, vocabulary, and energy is in large part due to the personality of the person with whom I'm interacting. In some sense, that may be why I have the friends that I have. Some friends prompt philosophical thoughts and conversations; some like talking about what it's like for work to be your life (as opposed to simply recounting past events); and some about random interesting or funny things which make me feel like a richer person. It's this balance that brings me joy in my friendships.

When I am around teenage girls, the energy that I receive makes me feel very much like what I can only term as "myself". Freud might call it many different things: sexual tension in an archetypal male-female role; an attempt to re-live the past, vicariously, fraudulently; a theft of youth wherein my old-ass self needs not only to feel young, but to also make them feel older; or a a father-daughter relationship in which I pretend to have all the answers, while they ask me questions. Or maybe it's a big brother feeling where I see them as people who I care about and want nothing but the best for them.

What I do know is that for all of the female students that I have taught / tutored, I see so much potential greatness, and so much potential hurt at the same time. I can not simply see these now-children / future-women as *only* who they are right at this moment. I also see far down their lifestreams, through the multitude of choices they will make in their lives, to the possibilities that they will cause to unfold through their choices.

And to these chicas, specifically, I want to say: be who you are, always. Don't change for anybody except yourself. You are not in a rush; you have time to figure things out. If something doesn't feel right, don't force it.  If something intrigues you, go after it. The person who you are right now is so special, so unique, and so mesmerizing. Don't give that up to become just like everyone else. You've still got a lot of life to live; you've still got a whole lot of love to give. It's OK to give it to people who don't deserve it; but don't ever see yourself as anything less than someone who is worthy of being loved fully, completely, always. Keep moving forward; don't ever get too comfortable. You are going to do great things someday; and I look forward to watching you, even from afar.

And that's exactly why I can't "get involved" with someone younger than 25. The things that I have learned, and been through, and lived, and am still living -- I don't feel like it would be fair to insert myself into someone's future like that. I've done that with someone, for 8 years off-and-on; We co-created a future, which became our shared present, which is now our individual past. Now that it's over, I can't see myself doing that again with anyone -- especially not with someone who has so many choices available at that point in their lives. I realize that I, too, have choices, but they are of a different nature, and therefore are not compatible (from my perspective) with the choices of those younger than me. In fact, I would prefer to have a relationship with someone older -- much older. A good 10 years or more. Because I would rather learn than teach at this point. Without any expectations. Can anyone say "commitment issues?"  =)

I thought I knew it all in High School. A decade later, I only know that I don't know. During my senior commencement speech, though, I quoted two different pieces of art which I believe deserve an honorable mention due to their relevancy over the years: [Swiss Army Romance by Dashboard Confessional](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dashboardconfessional/theswissarmyromance.html) and [Portrait of a Lady by T.S. Eliot](http://www.bartleby.com/198/2.html):

*Swiss Army Romance by Dashboard Confessional*
	We're not twenty-one,
	but the sooner we are,
	the sooner the fun will begin,
	so get out your fake eyelashes, 
	and fake i.d's,
	& real disasters ensue,
	it's cool to take these chances.
	it's cool to fake romances
	& grow up fast;
	& grow up fast;
	& grow up fast;
	grow up fast.

*Portrait of a Lady by T.S. Eliot*
	Now that lilacs are in bloom
	She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
	And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
	“Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
	What life is, you who hold it in your hands”;
	(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
	“You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
	And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
	And smiles at situations which it cannot see.”
	I smile, of course,
	And go on drinking tea.

And if that don't make you feel old; and wonder about your past decade; and help you appreciate how great it is to be beyond some insurmountable situations or unanswerable questions, then maybe you haven't climbed enough metaphorical mountains, or asked the right questions. Either way, that's just one man's opinion. Mine. FWIW.

P.S. I would like to dedicate this to a very special chica who allowed me to be a significant part of her lifestream for 8 years. Happy birthday, Makedo.
