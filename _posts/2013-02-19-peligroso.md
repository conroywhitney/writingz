I've been robbed here at least four times; only once under duress, though. Funny thing is that it always happens around the same place, around the same time, when I'm doing pretty much the same thing. You think I'd learn by now, but nope. I'm not sure what else there is to do about it, though, except to either never go out (read: develop [agoraphobia](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aagoraphobia)) or to just accept that when I do go out, I can expect my changes of getting robbed to be better than even.

I've learned that if you lie about how much money you have, you can usually get away with it without them calling your bluff, and you end up losing less. When lying, though, it's important to use a number that sounds legit; you can't just lie with a round number, cause who ever *only* has multiples of 5 or 10, really? You have to make up a silly number like Q31, even though you have Q131. All you have to do is make sure they don't see that one Q100 bill, and maybe then you'll be able to convince the other person that they're really not going to get anything more out of you -- at least not this time.

I wonder what it's like, to be on the other side of the table, so to speak. What is it like to take money from someone like that? To look at a gringo like me and think: "Eh, he can probably afford it." Does that make it alright? Would these types of situations even be happening if I was Petenitza? Or is it my fault for looking like a "touristo"?

For what it's worth, I try to make the best of these situations when possible. For example, this most recent time that I was robbed (just tonite, actually, no more than an hour ago), when I asked the driver how much, he quoted me an outrageous price. Unwilling to become such a victim, I said: "No soy estupido" and quoted a different price: the Q31 from my example before. It was still too much, in my opinion; in that sense, I definitely *feel* as though I were robbed. But then again, one of my favourite phrases (because I heard it from a history teacher at a Christian school) is: "You can't rape the willing."

And I guess in all of these cases, nobody *forced* me to get into the vehicle. I chose to, knowing full-well how much it was going to cost me. In most of my "I've been robbed!" circumstances, it was "late" at night (read: pre-midnight) and I just wanted to get home. And yeah, I do live kinda out of the way, and yeah, I might be the only fare they get while the next gallon of gas burns, so sure, it may be only economics for them.

No matter how much I can rationalize the reasons, the reality is still (to me) irrational: the same trip costs different amounts depending on the time of day, the mood of the driver, and how badly I want to get to where I'm going. Midday to the mall? Q5 per person, no questions asked. If a driver tried to charge more, you just blow him off, wait one minute, and you flag down a more rational driver. At this point in the day, going in this direction, a [Tuk Tuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw#Guatemala) is a commodity; everybody wants one, there's tonnes of them around, so everyone demands the lowest price. Coming back from the mall, though, you're gonna have to ante up a whole Q10 because you are taking them out of the way -- they could do two Q5 trips in half the time and make four times the money. Going to touristy Flores? That trip is a bit farther, so Q10 is fair. Coming back, though? Ugh. Good luck finding a fair fare. Not only are you taking them away from primo money-making land, you are also automatically considered naive and/or mentally retarded (read: gringo). No matter how much you try to talk the talk, unless you want to walk the walk all the way home, just pay the man.

I said I'd been robbed once under duress; it was by a Tuk Tuk driver coming back from Flores. He said Q20, I said Q5 (my advice: start low, saying "well that's how much it cost me to get here", even if that's not true). He said Q15, I said Q10. He said, "no thanks", I said "fine, I'll get out" (more advice: always ask before getting too far along in your trip; hard to negotiate once you're at your destination). He said, OK, Q10. I said, great. 30 seconds later he started to pull over to pick up two more people. I said Q15 it is, sir, as long as you don't try to pick up any more people. He kept driving. We both laughed.

As a passenger, in some ways, a Tuk Tuk is like a queen-sized bed: it's wonderful with one person; comfortable with two; but (depending on how well you know each other), a bit crowded with three. As a driver, it's all about economy of scale. If the motors could handle it, drivers would pile 8 people in the damn things: 3 people in the back seat (which they do on a regular basis, if you're unlucky enough to pass by another potential fare during your trip). But the drivers wouldn't stop there -- they'd want to pile in 3 more people sitting onto of the first 3 people's laps, with their heads cocked sideways, ears pressed against the top of the awning, head banging against the metal cage. From what I've seen, they would also want to have 1 person hanging off each side of the vehicle, just for safe measure. But since Tuk Tuks they are essentially 50cc dirt-bikes dragging a ferris-wheel seat, weight is a constant issue. In that sense, I'm surprised they don't charge me double, off the bat. Well, maybe they do.

The past two times that I have gotten a ride home at night, both drivers have gone out of their way to warn me about walking in my neighborhood area at night. It's "muy peligroso" they say. Dangerous? Really? Howso? They'll take my "dinero" you say? Well now that doesn't sound very nice, now, does it?

But let me put it this way --

I've been robbed (read: overcharged) here at least four times so far, and all four times it has been a taxi driver bringing me home through this supposedly "dangerous" area. Analyzing the data, statistics show that I am more likely to lose more money to price-gouging taxi drivers than I am to the people the drivers are warning me against.

Uh huh. You can keep your fear-mongering. Maybe next time I'll keep my money safe by not participating in the game wherein you take from me in excess of what is fair.

Peligroso, indeed.
